<h4>Transcriber’s Notes</h4>

<p>Obvious typographical errors have been silently corrected. Variations
in hyphenation have been standardised but all other spelling and
punctuation remains unchanged.
</p>

<p>The precise location of footnote 37 is speculative since it is not
indicated in the original.
</p>

<p>Al-Bertuni is only mentioned once in the book, with an anchor to a
footnote which is not present. The anchor has not been included.
</p>

<p>The first footnote to chapter VII has no anchor, nor any mention of the
apparent topic within the chapter so it has not been indexed.

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a><br />

<small>THE ORIGIN OF THE MANUSCRIPT</small></h2>


<p>The Arabic manuscript here translated was presented
to me before I left Mosul by my friend Dâud
aṣ-Ṣâîġ as a memento of our friendship. Ḫawâja
aṣ-Ṣâîġ was a man of culture, in sympathy with
western thought, and an intimate acquaintance of
M. N. Siouffi, the vice-consul of the French Republic
in Mosul. From the first page of the manuscript it
appears that through some Yezidis he had access to
their literature. I know he was in close touch with
many of them, especially with the family of Mulla
Ḥaidar, which is the only Yezidi family that can read
and guard the sacred tradition of the sect.</p>

<p>The manuscript comprises a brief Introduction, the
Sacred Books, and an Appendix. In the first, the
compiler indicates the sources of his information and
gives a sketch of the life of Šeiḫ ‘Adî, the chief saint
of the Yezidis.</p>

<p>The Sacred Books comprise <i>Kitâb al-Jilwah</i> (Book
of Revelation), and <i>Maṣḥaf Rêš</i> (Black Book)—so
named because in it mention is made of the descent of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
the Lord upon the Black Mountain (p. 32).
<i>Al Jilwah</i><a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> is ascribed to Šeiḫ ‘Adî himself, and would
accordingly date from the twelfth century <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> It is
divided into a brief introduction and five short chapters.
In each, ‘Adî is represented as the speaker. In
the Preface the Šeiḫ says that he existed with Melek
Tâ´ûs before the creation of the world, and that he
was sent by his god Tâ´ûs to instruct the Yezidi sect in
truth. In the first chapter he asserts his omnipresence
and omnipotence; in the second he claims to have
power to reward those who obey him and to punish
those who disobey him; in the third he declares that
he possesses the treasures of the earth; in the fourth
he warns his followers of the doctrines of those that
are without; and in the fifth he bids them keep his
commandments and obey his servants, who will communicate
to them his teachings. The <i>Black Book</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
which perhaps dates from the thirteenth century, is
larger than the Book of Revelation, but is not divided
into chapters. It begins with the narrative of creation:
God finishes his work in seven days—Sunday to Saturday.
In each day he creates an angel or king
(<i>melek</i>). Melek Ṭâ´ûs, who is created on Sunday, is
made chief of all. After that Fahr-ad Dîn creates
the planets, man, and animals. Then follows a story
about Adam and Eve, their temptation and quarrel;
the coming of the chief angels to the world to establish
the Yezidi kingdom; the flood; the miraculous birth of
Yezîd bn Mu‘awiya; and certain ordinances in regard
to food, the New Year, and marriages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

<p>The Appendix contains the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. A collection of materials concerning the Yezidi
belief and practice.</p>

<p>2. A poem in praise of Šeiḫ ‘Adî.</p>

<p>3. The principal prayer of the Yezidis, in the
Kurdish language.</p>

<p>4. A description of the Yezidi sacerdotal system.</p>

<p>5. A petition to the Ottoman government to exempt
the sect from military service, presented in the year
1872 A. D.</p></blockquote>

<p>An analysis of the texts shows that the material is
taken from different sources: part of it is clearly derived
from the religious books of the sect; another
part from a description of the beliefs and customs of
the sect given by a member of it to an outsider; a
third, partly from observations by an outsider, partly
from stories about Yezidis current among their Christian
neighbors. Unfortunately the compiler does not
specify whence each particular part of his information
is obtained. On closer examination it is evident that
part, at least, of the Arabic in hand is a translation
from Syriac.</p>

<p>The Yezidis, frequently called “Devil-Worshippers,”
are a small and obscure religious sect, numbering

northern and central Kurdistan and among the Sinjar
Hills of Northern Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>By reason of their mysterious religion, the Devil-Worshipers
have been an object of interest and investigation
for several generations. Our chief firsthand
sources of information in regard to the manners, customs,
and practices of these people are: Sir Henry
Layard, <i>Nineveh and its Remains</i> (1849), <i>Nineveh
and Babylon</i> (1853); G. P. Badger, <i>The Nestorians
and their Rituals</i> (1852); my honored teacher, Rev.
A. N. Andrus, veteran missionary of the A. B. C. F.M.,
resident in Mardin, Mesopotamia, “The Yezidis,”
in the <i>Encyclopaedia of Missions</i>; P. Anastase, “The
Yezidis,” in the Arabic periodical, <i>Al-Mašrik</i>, Vol. II
(1899); Professor A. V. Williams Jackson, of Columbia
University, <i>Persia Past and Present</i> (1906); “The
Yezidis,” in the <i>International Encyclopaedia, s. v.</i>;
also in <i>J A O S</i>, XXV, 178; M. N. Siouffi, in the <i>Journal
Asiatique</i>, 1882 (vii<sup>e</sup> série, T. 20), p. 252, and 1885
(viii<sup>e</sup> série, T. 5), p. 78. Siouffi was the first to discover
and establish the historical character of Šeiḫ
‘Adî, about whom the scholars had been puzzled. He
published an extract relating to ‘Adî from Ibn Ḫallikân’s
<i>Wafaiyât ‘al-Ayân</i> (bibliographical work). Of
the second-hand sources of information may be mentioned
<i>Les Yezidis</i>, by J. Menant (Paris, 1892), and
the article by Victor Dingelstedt, “The Yezidis,” in
the <i>Scottish Geographical Magazine</i>, Vol. XIV, pp.
259 ff.<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p>In addition to these descriptions, several manuscripts
have come to light of recent years which give a great
deal of information about the beliefs and customs of
the Yezidis.</p>

<p>Two of these manuscripts are in the Bibliothèque
Nationale, in Paris (<i>Fond Syriaque</i>, Nos. 306 and
325). A translation of the Arabic (Carshuni) texts in
these manuscripts relative to the Yezidis was published
by Professor E. H. Browne in an appendix to O. H.
Parry, <i>Six Months in a Syrian Monastery</i>, 1895.
Professor Browne at that time proposed to edit the
Arabic text (see J.-B. Chabot, <i>Journal Asiatique</i>,
1896, ix<sup>e</sup> série, T. 7, p. 100); but so far as I can ascertain
this intention has not been carried out.</p>

<p>The manuscript translated by Browne, which according
to Parry (<i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 357) was written by a
native of Mosul, seems to be closely related to that
translated below. There are, however, some differences
in contents and arrangement: my copy is divided
into the Book of Revelation, the Black Book, and an
Appendix; while Browne’s embraces the Book of Revelation
which corresponds to that in my manuscript),
and two other “Accounts,” the greater part
of which is contained in the Black Book of my text,
and the rest in the Appendix. Further, in my manuscript
<i>Al-Jilwah</i> immediately follows the Introduction;
while in Browne’s the discussion of the sacerdotal system,
the petition to the Ottoman government, and
some other matters, are inserted between the Introduction
and <i>Al-Jilwah</i>. In Browne’s, moreover, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
Poem in Praise of Šeiḫ ‘Adî, and the Principal Prayer
(in Kurdish) are absent, while the petition to the
Turkish government is briefer, and lacks articles iv
and xiv. The text of this petition, in its original form,
was published by Lidzbarski in <i>Z D M G</i>, LI, 592 ff.,
after a manuscript in Berlin which was procured from
Šammas Eremia Šamir.</p>

<p>Two Syriac texts have also been printed. The first,
edited and translated by J.-B. Chabot in the <i>Journal
Asiatique</i>, 1896 (ix<sup>e</sup> série, T. 7), p. 100 ff., from the
Paris manuscripts referred to above, corresponds, with
slight variations, to the second “Account,” of Browne
(Parry, <i>loc. cit.</i>, pp. 380-87).</p>

<p>The second was published with an Italian translation,
by Samuel Giamil, under the title, <i>Monte Singar;
Storia di un Popolo Ignoto</i> (Rome, 1900), from a
manuscript copied for him in 1899 from an original
in the monastery of Rabban Hormizd. The author of
this work, a Syrian priest, Isaac, lived for a long
time among the Yezidis, and not only had unusual
opportunities of observation, but, as is evident from
several anecdotes, possessed their confidence and esteem
in a singular degree. His work is in catechetical
form: a youthful Yezidi inquirer questions a teacher
about the beliefs, traditions, and customs of his people,
and the answers contain the fullest exposition of these
matters we at present possess. Occasionally the author
falls out of his role, and lets it appear that the
questioner is no other than Priest Isaac himself.</p>

<p>The work is divided into ten sections, which treat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
respectively of the works of God and his abode (p. 3);
the creation of Adam and Eve (p. 8); the wonderful
deeds of the god Yezîd (p. 16); the Yezidi saints
(p. 27); the New-Year (p. 32); marriage customs
(p. 46); death and burial (p. 53); the pilgrimage to
Šeiḫ ‘Adî’s shrine (p. 67); the festivals and assemblies
at Šeiḫ ‘Adî (p. 80); and the Yezidi kings (p. 87).</p>

<p>Apart from the <i>Kitâb al-Jilwah</i>, Priest Isaac’s work
is clearly the source from which is derived most of
the material in the Syriac and Arabic manuscripts that
have hitherto come to light.</p>

<p>Beside the Arabic manuscript from Dâud aṣ-Ṣâîḡ
which is translated below, I have in my possession two
others, which were sent me by the Rev. A. N. Andrus.
The first of these written by Šammas Eremia Šamir
(designated in the notes hereafter as SS), seems to
be a duplicate of that from which Browne’s translation
was made. They agree in contents and arrangement,
and in certain readings in which they differ from the
other texts. At the close of SS the writer says that
he compiled it (chiefly from <i>Al-Jilwah</i>) for the benefit
of some of his friends who wished to acquaint themselves
with the Yezidi religion.</p>

<p>The origin of the Yezidi sect has been the subject
of much discussion, but no satisfactory solution of the
problem has as yet been reached. There are those
who assert that the Yezidis are the remains of the
ancient Manichaeans;<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> others entertain the view that
the Yezidis were originally Christians, whom progressive
ignorance has brought into their present con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>dition<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>—some
even going so far as to connect the
name “Yezidi” with “Jesus”!<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> Some think that the
Yezidi sect takes its name from the Persian word
<i>yazd</i>, ‘god, or good spirit,’ over against Ahriman, the
evil principle;<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> while others associate it with <i>Yazd</i> or
<i>Yezid</i>, a town in central Persia, the inhabitants of
which are chiefly Parsees.<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> Some finally maintain that
the sect was founded by Šeiḫ ‘Adî.<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>The Yezidis themselves had a curious legend connecting
the name with the Caliph Yezîd bn Mu‘âwiya<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
(see <a href='#Page_37'>p. 37</a>).</p>

<p>In a dissertation presented for the degree of Doctor
of Philosophy in Harvard University I called attention
to a statement of aš-Šahrastânî the importance
of which seems hitherto not to have been appreciated,
but which appears to me to give the most probable explanation
of the name and of the original affinities of
the sect. The passage is as follows (<i>Kitâb al Milal
wan-Nihal</i>, ed. Cureton, I, 101):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Yezidis are the followers of Yezîd bn Unaisa,
who kept friendship with the first Muhakkama, before
the Azariḳa; he separated himself from those who
followed after them with the exception of the
Abadiyah,<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> for with these he kept friendly. He believed
that God would send an apostle from among the
Persians, and would reveal to him a book that is already
written in heaven, and would reveal the whole
(book) to him at one time,<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> and as a result he would
leave the religion of Mohammed, the Chosen One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>—may
God bless and save him!—and follow the religion
of the Sabians mentioned in the Koran.<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> (These are
not the Sabians who are found in Ḥarân and Wasit.<a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>)
But Yezîd associated himself with the people of the
Book who recognized the Chosen One as a prophet,
even though they did not accept his (Mohammed’s)
religion. And he said that the followers of the ordinances
are among those who agree with him; but that
others are hiding the truth and give companions to
God, and that every sin, small or great, is idolatry.<a id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The statement of Aš-Šahrastânî is so clear that it
can bear no other interpretation than that the Yezidis
were the followers of Yezîd bn Unaisa. He calls
them his <i>´aṣḥâb</i>, that is, his followers, a term by which
he designates the relation between a sect and its
founder.<a id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> The statement comes from the pen of one
who is considered of the highest authority among the
Arab scholars on questions relating to philosophical
and religious sects.<a id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> This precise definition of the
position of Yezîd bn Unaisa in the sectarian conflicts
of the first century of Islam seems to show that he had
exact information about him.</p>

<p>The prediction about the Persian prophet is quoted,
almost in the same words, by another great Mohammedan
authority on religious sects, Ibn Ḥazm, who
lived a century before Aš-Šahrastânî. (The Egyptian
edition of Ibn Ḥazm, Vol. IV, p. 188, reads Zaid bn
Abi <i>Ubaisa</i>; but that Unaisa should be restored is evident
from the fact that Ibn Ḥazm is at pains to distinguish
the author of this unorthodox prediction from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
the well-known traditionist of the name—e. g., Tabari,
I, 135.<a id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>The prophecy was perhaps preserved among the
leaders of the Abaḍiya, with which sect Yezîd bn
Unaisa is associated. Aš-Šahrastânî’s statement, the
significant part of which we have found also in Ibn
Ḥazm was doubtless derived from an older written
source.</p>

<p>Who is intended by the coming Persian prophet—if,
indeed, any particular individual is meant—it is not
possible to determine. Kremer<a id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> cannot be right in
identifying him with Šeiḫ ‘Adî, for the supposed prediction
was in circulation a century or more before
his time. He is said to have been, not a Persian, but
a Syrian from Baalbek or elsewhere in the West; and
both in Arabic authors<a id="FNanchor_21_21" href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> and in his own writings<a id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> he
appears as a Moslem, a Sufi saint in good standing.
The Yezidis to this day await the appearance of the
Persian prophet.<a id="FNanchor_23_23" href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>On the basis of these scanty bits of fact, it appears
that: The Yezidis were originally a Ḫarijite<a id="FNanchor_24_24" href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> sub-sect,
akin to the Abadiya, bearing the name of their
founder, Yezîd bn Unaisa. Certain distinctive Ḫarijite
peculiarities seem indeed to have outlived among
them the common faith of Islam; such as the tolerant
judgment of Jews and Christians; the condemnation
of every sin as implicit idolatry. In their new seats
in Kurdistan, whither they migrated about the end of
the fourteenth century<a id="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> they were drawn into the
movement of which Šeiḫ ‘Adî was in his life time the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
leader and after his death the saint, and ended by
making of him the incarnation of God in the present
age.<a id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> With this they joined elements drawn from
Christianity,<a id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> with here and there a trace of Judaism,
and with large survivals of the persistent old Semitic
heathenism, many of which they share with their
neighbors of all creeds.</p>

<p>Difficult problems,<a id="FNanchor_28_28" href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> however, remain unsolved, especially
the origin and nature of the worship of Melek
Ṭâ´ûs.<a id="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> The certain thing is that the actual religion
of the Yezidis is a syncretism, to which Moslem,
Christian (heretical, rather than orthodox), pagan,
and perhaps also Persian religions have contributed.<a id="FNanchor_30_30" href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

Al-Jilwah is said to have been written in
558 A. H., by Šeiḫ Faḫr-ad-Dîn, the secretary of
Šeiḫ ‘Adî, at the dictation of the latter. The original
copy, wrapped in linen and silk wrappings, is kept in
the house of Mulla Ḥaidar, of Baadrie. Twice a year
the book is taken to Šeiḫ ‘Adî’s shrine. (Letter from

Ibn Ḫallikân says: “Aš-Šahrastânî, a dogmatic
theologian of the Ašarite sect, was distinguished as an
Imâm and a doctor of the law. He displayed the highest
abilities as a jurisconsult. The <i>Kitâb al-Milal wa-n-Nihal</i>
(this is the book in which Aš-Šahrastânî traces
the Yezidi sect to Yezîd bn Unaisa) is one of his works
on scholastic theology. He remained without an equal
in that branch of science.”</p></div>

Such as their ceremonies at Šeiḫ ‘Adî (Badger,

Professor Jackson, of Columbia University,
seems to trace it to the “old devil-worship in Mazandaran”
(<i>J A O S</i>, XXV, 178). But it is not certain that
the Yezidis believe in Melek Ṭâ´ûs as an evil spirit.
In the history of religion the god of one people is the
devil of another. Asura is a deity in the Rig Veda and
an evil spirit only in later Brahman theology. In Islam
the gods of heathenism are degraded into jinns, just
as the gods of North Semitic heathenism are called
še‘îrîm (hairy demons) in Lev. 17:7; or as the gods
of Greece and Rome became devils to early Christians.
See W. R. Smith, <i>Religion of the Semites</i>, p. 120;
Fihrist, pp. 322, 326.
</p>
<p>
Professor M. Lidzbarski (<i>Z D M G</i>, LI, 592), on the
other hand, argues that Ṭâ´ûs is the god Tammuz. His
contention is based on the assumption that the word
Ṭâ´ûs must embody the ancient god; that in Fihrist,
322, the god Tâuz has a feast on the 15th of Tammuz
(July); that in Kurdish, the language of the Yezidis,
<i>m</i> is frequently changed to <i>w</i>. This theory also is
untenable, for one might guess at any ancient god.
The exact form of the name “Tauz” is uncertain (see
Chwolsohn, <i>Die Ssabier</i>, II, 202); the statement that
in Kurdish <i>m</i> is frequently changed to <i>w</i> is not true,
if one would set it up as a grammatical rule to explain
such phenomena; the Kurdish-speaking people never
pronounce Tammuz, “Tauz;” and, finally, in the
Yezidi conception of Melek Ṭâ´ûs there are no traces
of the notion held respecting Tammuz.</p>

Such a state of affairs finds a historical parallel
in other religions. Take, for example, Christianity.
In it we find that the distinctive characteristics of the
founder have been wrapped up in many foreign elements
brought in by those who came from other
religions.</p>

<p>In the time of Al-Muḳtadir Billah, A. H. 295,<a id="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> there
lived Manṣûr-al-Ḥallâj,<a id="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> the wool-carder, and Šeiḫ
‘Abd-al-ḳâdir of Jîlân.<a id="FNanchor_33_33" href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> At that time, too, there appeared
a man by the name of Šeiḫ ‘Adî, from the
mountain of Hakkari,<a id="FNanchor_34_34" href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> originally from the region of
Aleppo or Baalbek. He came and dwelt in Mount
Lališ,<a id="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> near the city of Moṣul, about nine hours distant
from it. Some say he was of the people of
Ḥarrân, and related to Marwân ibn-al-Ḥakam. His
full name is Šaraf ad-Dîn Abû-l-Fadâîl, ‘Adî bn
Musâfir bn Ismael bn Mousa bn Marwân bn Al-Ḥasan
bn Marwân. He died A. H. 558 (A. D. 1162-63). His
tomb is still visited; it is near Ba‘adrei, one of the
villages of Moṣul, distant eleven hours. The Yezidis
are the progeny of those who were the <i>murids</i> (disciples)
of Šeiḫ ‘Adî. Some trace their origin to
Yezid,<a id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> others to Ḥasan-Al-Baṣrî.<a id="FNanchor_37_37" href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p class="center">AL-JILWAH (THE REVELATION)</p>


<p>Before all creation this revelation was with Melek
Tâ´ûs, who sent ‘Abd Tâ´ûs to this world that he
might separate truth known to his particular people.
This was done, first of all, by means of oral tradition,
and afterward by means of this book, Al-Jilwah,
which the outsiders may neither read nor behold.</p>

<p>I was, am now, and shall have no end. I exercise
dominion over all creatures and over the affairs of
all who are under the protection of my image. I am
ever present to help all who trust in me and call upon
me in time of need. There is no place in the universe
that knows not my presence. I participate in all the
affairs which those who are without call evil because
their nature is not such as they approve. Every age
has its own manager, who directs affairs according to
my decrees. This office is changeable from generation
to generation, that the ruler of this world and his
chiefs may discharge the duties of their respective
offices every one in his own turn. I allow everyone
to follow the dictates of his own nature, but he that
opposes me will regret it sorely. No god has a right
to interfere in my affairs, and I have made it an
imperative rule that everyone shall refrain from worshiping
all gods. All the books of those who are
without are altered by them; and they have declined
from them, although they were written by the prophets
and the apostles. That there are interpolations is
seen in the fact that each sect endeavors to prove that
the others are wrong and to destroy their books. To
me truth and falsehood are known. When temptation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
comes, I give my covenant to him that trusts in me.
Moreover, I give counsel to the skilled directors, for
I have appointed them for periods that are known to
me. I remember necessary affairs and execute them
in due time. I teach and guide those who follow my
instruction. If anyone obey me and conform to my
commandments, he shall have joy, delight, and
goodness.</p>

<p>I requite the descendants of Adam, and reward
them with various rewards that I alone know. Moreover,
power and dominion over all that is on earth,
both that which is above and that which is beneath,
are in my hand. I do not allow friendly association
with other people, nor do I deprive them that are my
own and that obey me of anything that is good for
them. I place my affairs in the hands of those whom
I have tried and who are in accord with my desires.
I appear in divers manners to those who are faithful
and under my command. I give and take away; I
enrich and impoverish; I cause both happiness and
misery. I do all this in keeping with the characteristics
of each epoch. And none has a right to interfere
with my management of affairs. Those who oppose
me I afflict with disease; but my own shall not die like
the sons of Adam that are without. None shall live in
this world longer than the time set by me; and if I so
desire, I send a person a second or a third time into
this world or into some other by the transmigration
of souls.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h3>


<p>I lead to the straight path without a revealed book;
I direct aright my beloved and my chosen ones by unseen
means. All my teachings are easily applicable to
all times and all conditions. I punish in another world
all who do contrary to my will. Now the sons of
Adam do not know the state of things that is to come.
For this reason they fall into many errors. The
beasts of the earth, the birds of heaven, and the fish
of the sea are all under the control of my hands. All
treasures and hidden things are known to me; and
as I desire, I take them from one and bestow them
upon another. I reveal my wonders to those who seek
them, and in due time my miracles to those who receive
them from me. But those who are without are my
adversaries, hence they oppose me. Nor do they know
that such a course is against their own interests, for
might, wealth, and riches are in my hand, and I bestow
them upon every worthy descendant of Adam.
Thus the government of the worlds, the transition of
generations, and the changes of their directors are
determined by me from the beginning.</p>

<p>I will not give my rights to other gods. I have allowed
the creation of four substances, four times, and
four corners; because they are necessary things for
creatures. The books of Jews, Christians, and Moslems,
as of those who are without, accept in a sense,
i. e., so far as they agree with, and conform to, my
statutes. Whatsoever is contrary to these they have
altered; do not accept it. Three things are against
me, and I hate three things. But those who keep my
secrets shall receive the fulfilment of my promises.
Those who suffer for my sake I will surely reward in
one of the worlds. It is my desire that all my followers
shall unite in a bond of unity, lest those who are
without prevail against them. Now, then, all ye who
have followed my commandments and my teachings,
reject all the teachings and sayings of such as are without.
I have not taught these teachings, nor do they
proceed from me. Do not mention my name nor my
attributes, lest ye regret it; for ye do not know what
those who are without may do.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</h3>


<p>O ye that have believed in me, honor my symbol
and my image, for they remind you of me. Observe
my laws and statutes. Obey my servants and listen
to whatever they may dictate to you of the hidden
things. Receive that that is dictated, and do not carry
it before those who are without, Jews, Christians, Moslems,
and others; for they know not the nature of my
teaching. Do not give them your books, lest they alter
them without your knowledge. Learn by heart the
greater part of them, lest they be altered.</p>

<p>Thus endeth the book of Al-Jilwah, which is followed
by the book of Maṣḥaf Reš, i. e., the Black
Book.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Mashaf Reš (The Black Book)</span></h4>

<p>In the beginning God created the White Pearl out
of his most precious essence. He also created a bird
named Angar. He placed the White Pearl on the back
of the bird, and dwelt on it for forty thousand years.
On the first day, Sunday, God created Melek Anzazîl,
and he is Ṭâ´ûs-Melek, the chief of all. On Monday
he created Melek Dardâel, and he is Šeiḫ Ḥasan.
Tuesday he created Melek Israfel, and he is Šeiḫ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
Šams (ad-Dîn). Wednesday he created Melek Miḫâel,
and he is Šeiḫ Abû Bakr. Thursday he created Melek
Azrâel, and he is Sajad-ad-Dîn. Friday he created
Melek Šemnâel, and he is Naṣir-ad-Dîn. Saturday he
created Melek Nurâel, and he is Yadin (Faḫr-ad-Dîn).
And he made Melek Ṭâ´ûs ruler over all.<a id="FNanchor_38_38" href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>After this God made the form of the seven heavens,
the earth, the sun, and the moon. But Faḫr-ad-Dîn
created man and the animals, and birds and beasts.
He put them all in pockets of cloth, and came out of
the Pearl accompanied by the Angels. Then he shouted
at the Pearl with a loud voice. Thereupon the White
Pearl broke up into four pieces, and from its midst
came out the water which became an ocean. The
world was round, and was not divided. Then he
created Gabriel and the image of the bird. He sent
Gabriel to set the four corners. He also made a vessel
and descended in it for thirty thousand years.
After this he came and dwelt in Mount Lališ. Then
he cried out at the world, and the sea became solidified
and the land appeared, but it began to shake. At this
time he commanded Gabriel to bring two pieces of the
White Pearl; one he placed beneath the earth, the
other stayed at the gate of heaven. He then placed in
them the sun and the moon; and from the scattered
pieces of the White Pearl he created the stars which
he hung in heaven as ornaments. He also created
fruit-bearing trees and plants and mountains for ornaments
to the earth. He created the throne over the
carpet.<a id="FNanchor_39_39" href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> Then the Great God said: “O Angels, I will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
create Adam and Eve; and from the essence of Adam
shall proceed Šehar bn Jebr, and of him a separate
community shall appear upon the earth, that of Azazîl,
i. e., that of Melek Ṭâ´ûs, which is the sect of the
Yezidis. Then he sent Šeiḫ ‘Adî bn Musâfir from the
land of Syria, and he came (and dwelt in Mount)
Lališ. Then the Lord came down to the Black Mountain.
Shouting, he created thirty thousand Meleks, and
divided them into three divisions. They worshiped
him for forty thousand years, when he delivered them
to Melek Ṭâ´ûs who went up with them to heaven.
At this time the Lord came down to the Holy Land
(al-ḳuds), and commanded Gabriel to bring earth
from the four corners of the world, earth, air, fire,
and water. He created it and put in it the spirit of
his own power, and called it Adam.</p>

<p>Then he commanded Gabriel to escort Adam into
Paradise, and to tell him that he could eat from all
the trees but not of wheat.<a id="FNanchor_40_40" href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> Here Adam remained
for a hundred years. Thereupon, Melek Ṭâ´ûs asked
God how Adam could multiply and have descendants
if he were forbidden to eat of the grain. God answered,
“I have put the whole matter into thy hands.”
Thereupon Melek Ṭâ´ûs visited Adam and said “Have
you eaten of the grain?” He answered, “No, God
forbade me.” Melek Ṭâ´ûs replied and said, “Eat of
the grain and all shall go better with thee.” Then
Adam ate of the grain and immediately his belly was
inflated. But Melek Ṭâ´ûs drove him out of the garden,
and leaving him, ascended into heaven. Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
Adam was troubled because his belly was inflated, for
he had no outlet. God therefore sent a bird to him
which pecked at his anus and made an outlet, and
Adam was relieved.</p>

<p>Now Gabriel was away from Adam for a hundred
years. And Adam was sad and weeping. Then God
commanded Gabriel to create Eve from under the left
shoulder of Adam. Now it came to pass, after the
creation of Eve and of all the animals, that Adam and
Eve quarreled over the question whether the human
race should be descended from him or her, for each
wished to be the sole begetter of the race. This quarrel
originated in their observation of the fact that
among animals both the male and the female were
factors in the production of their respective species.
After a long discussion Adam and Eve agreed on this:
each should cast his seed into a jar, close it, and seal
it with his own seal, and wait for nine months. When
they opened the jars at the completion of this period,
they found in Adam’s jar two children, male and female.
Now from these two our sect, the Yezidis, are
descended. In Eve’s jar they found naught but rotten
worms emitting a foul odor. And God caused nipples
to grow for Adam that he might suckle the children
that proceeded from his jar. This is the reason why
man has nipples.</p>

<p>After this Adam knew Eve, and she bore two children,
male and female; and from these the Jews, the
Christians, the Moslems, and other nations and sects
are descended. But our first fathers are Šeth, Noah,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
and Enosh, the righteous ones, who were descended
from Adam only.</p>

<p>It came to pass that trouble arose between a man and
his wife, resulting from the denial on the part of the
woman that the man was her husband. The man
persisted in his claim that she was his wife. The
trouble between the two was settled, however, through
one of the righteous men of our sect, who decreed
that at every wedding a drum and a pipe should be
played as a testimony to the fact that such a man and
such a woman were married legally.</p>

<p>Then Melek Ṭâ´ûs came down to earth for our sect
(i. e., the Yezidis), the created ones, and appointed
kings for us, besides the kings of ancient Assyria,
Nisroch, who is Našir-ad-Dîn; Kamush, who is Melek
Faḫr-ad-Dîn, and Artâmîs, who is Melek Šams-(ad-)Dîn.
After this we had two kings, Šabur (Sapor)
First (224-272 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span>) and Second (309-379), who
reigned one hundred and fifty years; and our amirs
down to the present day have been descended from
their seed. But we hated four kings.</p>

<p>Before Christ came into this world our religion was
paganism. King Ahab was from among us. And the
god of Ahab was called Beelzebub. Nowadays we call
him Pir Bub. We had a king in Babylon, whose name
was Baḫtnaṣar; another in Persia, whose name was
Aḥšuraš; and still another in Constantinople, whose
name was Agriḳâlus. The Jews, the Christians, the
Moslems, and even the Persians, fought us; but they
failed to subdue us, for in the strength of the Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
we prevailed against them. He teaches us the first
and last science. And one of his teachings is:</p>

<p>Before heaven and earth existed, God was on the
sea, as we formerly wrote you. He made himself a
vessel and traveled in it in <i>kunsiniyat</i><a id="FNanchor_41_41" href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> of the seas,
thus enjoying himself in himself. He then created the
White Pearl and ruled over it for forty years. Afterward,
growing angry at the Pearl, he kicked it; and it
was a great surprise to see the mountains formed out
of its cry; the hills out of its wonders; the heavens
out of its smoke. Then God ascended to heaven, solidified
it, established it without pillars. He then spat
upon the ground, and taking a pen in hand, began to
write a narrative of all the creation.</p>

<p>In the beginning he created six gods from himself
and from his light, and their creation was as one lights
a light from another light. And God said, “Now I
have created the heavens; let some one of you go up
and create something therein.” Thereupon the second
god ascended and created the sun; the third, the moon;
the fourth, the vault of heaven; the fifth, the <i>farḡ</i>
(i. e., the morning star); the sixth, paradise; the
seventh, hell. We have already told you that after this
they created Adam and Eve.</p>

<p>And know that besides the flood of Noah, there was
another flood in this world. Now our sect, the Yezidis,
are descended from Na‘umi, an honored person, king
of peace. We call him Melek Miran. The other sects
are descended from Ham, who despised his father.
The ship rested at a village called ‘Ain Sifni,<a id="FNanchor_42_42" href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> distant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
from Mosul about five parasangs. The cause of the
first flood was the mockery of those who were without,
Jews, Christians, Moslems, and others descended
from Adam and Eve. We, on the other hand, are
descended from Adam only, as already indicated. This
second flood came upon our sect, the Yezidis. As the
water rose and the ship floated, it came above Mount
Sinjar,<a id="FNanchor_43_43" href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> where it ran aground and was pierced by a
rock. The serpent twisted itself like a cake and
stopped the hole. Then the ship moved on and rested
on Mount Judie.</p>

<p>Now the species of the serpent increased, and began
to bite man and animal. It was finally caught and
burned, and from its ashes fleas were created. From
the time of the flood until now are seven thousand
years. In every thousand years one of the seven gods
descends to establish rules, statutes, and laws, after
which he returns to his abode. While below, he sojourns
with us, for we have every kind of holy places.
This last time the god dwelt among us longer than any
of the other gods who came before him. He confirmed
the saints. He spoke in the Kurdish language. He
also illuminated Mohammed, the prophet of the Ishmaelites,
who had a servant named Mu‘âwiya. When
God saw that Mohammed was not upright before him,
he afflicted him with a headache. The prophet then
asked his servant to shave his head, for Mu‘âwiya
knew how to shave. He shaved his master in haste,
and with some difficulty. As a result, he cut his head
and made it bleed. Fearing that the blood might drop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
to the ground, Mu‘âwiya licked it with his tongue.
Whereupon Mohammed asked, “What are you doing,
Mu‘âwiya?” He replied, “I licked thy blood with my
tongue, for I feared that it might drop to the ground.”
Then Mohammed said to him, “You have sinned, O
Mu‘âwiya, you shall draw a nation after you. You
shall oppose my sect.” Mu‘âwiya answered and said,
“Then I will not enter the world; I will not marry.”</p>

<p>It came to pass that after some time God sent scorpions
upon Mu‘âwiya, which bit him, causing his face
to break out with poison. Physicians urged him to
marry lest he die. Hearing this, he consented. They
brought him an old woman, eighty years of age, in
order that no child might be born. Mu‘âwiya knew
his wife, and in the morning she appeared a woman
of twenty-five, by the power of the great God. And
she conceived and bore our god Yezid. But the foreign
sects, ignorant of this fact, say that our god came
from heaven, dispised and driven out by the great
God. For this reason they blaspheme him. In this
they have erred. But we, the Yezidi sect, believe this
not, for we know that he is one of the above-mentioned
seven gods. We know the form of his person and his
image. It is the form of a cock which we possess.
None of us is allowed to utter his name, nor anything
that resembles it, such as <i>šeitân</i> (Satan), <i>ḳaitân</i>
(cord), <i>šar</i> (evil), <i>šat</i> (river), and the like. Nor do
we pronounce <i>mal‘ûn</i> (accursed), or <i>la‘anat</i> (curse),
or <i>na‘al</i><a id="FNanchor_44_44" href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> (horseshoe), or any word that has a similar
sound. All these are forbidden us out of respect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
for him. So <i>ḫass</i> (lettuce) is debarred. We do not
eat it, for it sounds like the name of our prophetess
Ḫassiah. Fish is prohibited, in honor of Jonah the
prophet. Likewise deer, for deer are the sheep of one
of our prophets. The peacock is forbidden to our
Šeiḫ and his disciples, for the sake of our Ṭâ´ûs.
Squash also is debarred. It is forbidden to pass water
while standing, or to dress up while sitting down, or
to go to the toilet room, or to take a bath according to
the custom of the people.<a id="FNanchor_45_45" href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> Whosoever does contrary
to this is an infidel. Now the other sects, Jews, Christians,
Moslems, and others, know not these things, because
they dislike Melek Ṭâ´ûs. He, therefore, does
not teach them, nor does he visit them. But he dwelt
among us; he delivered to us the doctrines, the rules,
and the traditions, all of which have become an inheritance,
handed down from father to son. After
this, Melek Ṭâ´ûs returned to heaven.</p>

<p>One of the seven gods made the <i>sanjaḳs</i><a id="FNanchor_46_46" href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> (standards)
and gave them to Solomon the wise. After his
death our kings received them. And when our god,
the barbarian Yezîd, was born, he received these
<i>sanjaḳs</i> with great reverence, and bestowed them upon
our sect. Moreover, he composed two songs in the
Kurdish language to be sung before the <i>sanjaḳas</i> in this
language, which is the most ancient and acceptable
one. The meaning of the song is this:</p>

<p class="center">
Hallelujah to the jealous God.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<p>As they sing it, they march before the <i>sanjaḳs</i> with
timbrels and pipes. These <i>sanjaḳs</i> remain with our
emir, who sits on the throne of Yezîd. When these
are sent away, the <i>ḳawwâls</i> assemble with the emir,
and the great general, the šeiḫ, who is the representative
of Šeiḫ Nasir-ad-Dîn, i. e., Nisroch, god of the
ancient Assyrians.<a id="FNanchor_47_47" href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> They visit the <i>sanjaḳs</i>. Then they
send each <i>sanjaḳ</i> in care of a <i>ḳawwâl</i> to its own place;
one to Ḫalataneye, one to Aleppo, one to Russia, and
one to Sinjar. These <i>sanjaḳs</i> are given to four <i>ḳawwâls</i>
by contract. Before they are sent, they are
brought to Šeiḫ ‘Adî’s tomb, where they are baptized
amid great singing and dancing. After this each of
the contractors takes a load of dust from Šeiḫ ‘Adî’s
tomb. He fashions it into small balls, each about the
size of a gall nut, and carries them along with the
<i>sanjaḳs</i> to give them away as blessings. When he
approaches a town, he sends a crier before him to
prepare the people to accept the <i>ḳawwâl</i> and his <i>sanjaḳ</i>
with respect and honor. All turn out in fine clothes,
carrying incense. The women shout, and all together
sing joyful songs. The <i>ḳawwâl</i> is entertained by the
people with whom he stops. The rest give him silver
presents, everyone according to his means.</p>

<p>Besides these four <i>sanjaḳs</i>, there are three others,
seven in all. These three are kept in a sacred place
for purposes of healing. Two of them, however, remain
with Šeiḫ ‘Adî, and the third remains in the
village of Baḥazanie, which is distant from Mosul
about four hours. Every four months these <i>ḳawwâls</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
travel about. One of them must travel in the province
of the emir. They travel in a fixed order, differing
each year. Every time he goes out, the traveler must
cleanse himself with water made sour with <i>summaḳ</i>
(sumac) and anoint himself with an oil. He must also
light a lamp at each idol that has a chamber. This is
the law that pertains to the <i>sanjaḳs</i>.</p>

<p>The first day of our new year is called the <i>Serṣâlie</i>,
i. e., the beginning of a year. It falls on the Wednesday
of the first week in April.<a id="FNanchor_48_48" href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> On that day there
must be meat in every family. The wealthy must
slaughter a lamb or an ox; the poor must kill a chicken
or something else. These should be cooked on the
night, the morning of which is Wednesday, New
Year’s day. With the break of day the food should
be blessed. On the first day of the year alms should
be given at tombs where the souls of the dead lie.</p>

<p>Now the girls, large and small, are to gather from
the fields flowers of every kind that have a reddish
color. They are to make them into bundles, and, after
keeping them three days, they are to hang them on the
doors<a id="FNanchor_49_49" href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> as a sign of the baptism of the people living
in the houses. In the morning all doors will be seen
well decorated with red lilies. But women are to feed
the poor and needy who pass by and have no food;
this is to be done at the graves. But as to the <i>ḳawwâls</i>,
they are to go around the tombs with timbrels, singing
in the Kurdish language. For so doing they are entitled
to money. On the above-mentioned day of
<i>Serṣâlie</i> no instruments of joy are to be played, be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>cause
God is sitting on the throne (arranging decrees
for the year),<a id="FNanchor_50_50" href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> and commanding all the wise and the
neighbors to come to him. And when he tells them
that he will come down to earth with song and praise,
all arise and rejoice before him and throw upon each
the squash of the feast. Then God seals them with his
own seal. And the great God gives a sealed decision
to the god who is to come down. He, moreover, grants
him power to do all things according to his own will.
God prefers doing good and charity to fasting and
praying. The worship of any idol, such as Seyed-ad-Dîn
or Šeiḫ Šams is better than fasting. Some layman
is to give a banquet to a <i>kôchak</i> after the fasting of
the latter forty days, whether it be in summer or in
winter. If he (the <i>kôchak</i>) says this entertainment is
an alms given to the <i>sanjaḳ</i>, then he is not released
from his fasting. When it comes to pass that the
yearly tithe-gatherer finds that the people have not
fully paid their tithes, he whips them till they become
sick, and some even die. The people are to give the
<i>kôchaks</i> money to fight the Roman army, and thus
save the sect (Yezidis) from the wrath of the man of
the year.</p>

<p>Every Friday a load of gifts is to be brought as an
offering to an idol. At that time, a servant is to call
the people aloud from the roof of a <i>kôchak’s</i> house,
saying, it is the call of the prophet to a feast. All are
to listen reverently and respectfully; and, on hearing
it, every one is to kiss the ground and the stone on
which he happens to lean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p>It is our law that no <i>ḳawwâl</i> shall pass a razor over
his face. Our law regarding marriage is that at the
time of the wedding a loaf of bread shall be taken
from the house of a <i>kôchak</i> and be divided between
the bride and the bridegroom, each to eat one-half.
They may, however, eat some dust from Šeiḫ ‘Adî’s
tomb instead of the bread for a blessing. Marriage
in the month of April is forbidden, for it is the first
month of the year. This rule, however, does not apply
to <i>ḳawwâls</i>; they may marry during this month. No
layman is allowed to marry a <i>kôchak’s</i> daughter.
Everyone is to take a wife from his own class. But
our emir may have for a wife any one whom he pleases
to love. A layman may marry between the ages of
ten and eighty; he may take for a wife one woman
after another for a period of one year. On her way
to the house of the bridegroom, a bride must visit the
shrine of every idol she may happen to pass; even if
she pass a Christian church, she must do the same.
On her arrival at the bridegroom’s house, he must hit
her with a small stone in token of the fact that she
must be under his authority. Moreover, a loaf of
bread must be broken over her head as a sign to her
that she must love the poor and needy. No Yezidi
may sleep with his wife on the night the morning of
which is Wednesday, and the night the morning of
which is Friday. Whosoever does contrary to this
commandment is an infidel. If a man steal the wife
of his neighbor, or his own former wife, or her sister
or mother, he is not obliged to give her dowry, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
she is the booty of his hand. Daughters may not inherit
their father’s wealth. A young lady may be sold
as an acre of land is sold. If she refuses to be married,
then she must redeem herself by paying her
father a sum of money earned by her service and the
labor of her hand.</p>

<p>Here ends Kitâb Reš, which is followed by several
stories, some of which are told secretly, some openly.</p>

<h3 id="APPENDIX_TO_PART_I">APPENDIX TO PART I</h3>


<p>They say our hearts are our books, and our šeiḫs
tell us everything from the second Adam until now
and the future. When they notice the sun rise, they
kiss the place where the rays first fall; they do the
same at sunset, where its rays last fall. Likewise they
kiss the spot where the moon first casts its rays and
where it last casts them. They think, moreover, that
by the multiplication of presents to šeiḫs and idols they
keep troubles and afflictions away.</p>

<p>There is a great difference among the <i>ḳôchaks</i>, they
contradict one another. Some say, “Melek Ṭâ´ûs appears
to me and reveals to me many revelations.”
Others say, “We appear to people in many different
ways.” Some believe that Christ is Šeiḫ Šams himself.
They say that they have had prophets in all times; the
<i>ḳôchaks</i> are the prophets. One of the <i>ḳôchaks</i> says in
one of his prophecies: “I was in Jonah’s ship, where
a lot was cast in my presence. It fell on Jonah; and
he was thrown into the sea, where he remained forty
days and nights.” Another said: “I was sitting with
the great God, who said, ‘I hope the time will come
when I shall send Christ to the world.’ I said to him,
‘Yes.’ Then he sent him. After making a sign in the
sun, Christ came down to the earth.” He appeared to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
our sect only, and made for us seven circles, which are
at Šeiḫ ‘Adî. Now he appeared to us because we observe
the necessary order, which the other sects do
not observe. Their origin and race are unknown; ours
are known. We are emirs and sons of emirs; we are
šeiḫs and sons of šeiḫs; we are <i>ḳôchaks</i> and sons of
<i>ḳôchaks</i>, etc. But Christians and Moslems make
priests and mullas for themselves out of those who
had none of their kindred in those offices before, and
never will have afterward. We are better than they.
We are allowed to drink wine; our young men also
may desire it when they, in company with women,
engage in religious dancing and playing. Some of
the <i>ḳôchaks</i> and šeiḫs, however, are not allowed to
drink it. When one is about to die, he is visited by a
<i>ḳôchak</i>, who places a bit of Šeiḫ ‘Adî’s dust in his
mouth. Before he is buried his face is anointed with
it. Moreover, the dung of sheep is placed on his tomb.
Finally, food is offered on behalf of the dead. The
<i>ḳôchaks</i> pray for the dead at the graves, for which
service they are paid. They tell the relatives of the
dead what they see in dreams and visions, and the
condition of their dead, whether they have been translated
to the human or to the animal race. Some people
hide silver or gold coins that they plan to take out in
case they are born the second time in this world. Some
believe that the spirits of many righteous persons
travel in the air. Those spirits make revelations to the
<i>ḳôchaks</i>, who are acquainted with the world of mysteries
and secrets. Life and death are in their hands.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
Hence the fate of the people depends on the gratitude
and honor which they show the <i>ḳôchaks</i>. According
to Yezidis, hell has no existence. It was created in
the time of the first Adam, they say, when our father,
Ibrîḳ al-Aṣfar, was born.<a id="FNanchor_51_51" href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> By reason of his generosity
and noble deeds, Ibrîḳ had many friends. Now,
when he viewed hell he became very sad. He had a
small <i>baḳbûḳ aṣfar</i>,<a id="FNanchor_52_52" href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> into which, as he kept weeping
his tears fell. In seven years it was filled. He then
cast it into hell, and all its fires were put out that mankind
might not be tortured. This incident relates to
one of the noble deeds of our first father, Ibrîḳ al-Aṣfar.
They have many more such upright men of
noble deeds. Such an one is Mohammed Rašân, whose
resting place is behind the mount of Šeiḫ Mattie.<a id="FNanchor_53_53" href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>
He (Rašân) is exceedingly strong, so that the most
sacred oaths are sworn by him. If any one becomes
sick, he takes refuge in making vows to <i>ḫasin</i>, i. e.,
pillars of idols. Now there is a place of religious
pilgrimage which is called Sitt Nafîsah. This place
is a mulberry tree in the village of Ba‘ašîḳa. Another
such place is called ‘Abdi Rašân, and is in the
village of ḳarabek. A third place of pilgrimage is
in the village Baḥzanie, which is called Šeiḫ Bakû.
Nearby is a spring, and beside this is a mulberry tree.
Whoever is afflicted with fever, goes to that tree,
hangs on its branches a piece of cloth from his clothes,
and casts bread in the spring for the fish. All this
he does that he may be cured. They entertain the belief
that whoever unties or shakes off one of the shreds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
of cloth will catch the disease with which the man
was afflicted when he hung it up. There are many
such trees in the village of Ba‘ašîḳa, and in some other
places. There is also a spring of water, called in
the common language ‘Ain aṣ-Ṣafra (Yellow Spring).
The Yezidis call it Kanî-Zarr.<a id="FNanchor_54_54" href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> In this swim those
who are afflicted with the disease of <i>abû-ṣafar</i> (jaundice).
But those who are troubled with dropsy go
for cure to the house of the Pir that lives in the village
of Man Reš.</p>

<p>When they assemble at Šeiḫ ‘Adî’s, no one is allowed
to cook anything. Everyone is to eat from Šeiḫ ‘Adî’s
table. As to the <i>ḳôchaks</i>, every one of them sits on a
stone, as one sits in prayer. To them the laity go,
seeking succor. They give them money while making
their petition, and vow to the stone on which the
<i>ḳôchak</i> sits, sheep and oxen, everyone according to
his means. Now, at the New Year the places are given
in contract. When they assemble at the New Year,
they dance and play with instruments of joy. Before
eating the <i>kabdûš</i>, i. e., the vowed ox, they swim in the
water of Zamzam, a spring coming from beneath the
temple of Šeiḫ ‘Adî. Then they eat in haste, snatching
meat from the pot like fanatics, so that their hands
are frequently burned. This practice is in accordance
with their rules. After eating, they go up the mountain,
shooting with their guns, and then return to Šeiḫ
‘Adî. Everyone of them takes a little dust and preserves
it for the times of wedding and death. They
wear entwined girdles which they call the ties of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
back (belt). They baptize these and the <i>sanjaḳs</i> with
the water of Zamzam. He who is called Jawiš<a id="FNanchor_55_55" href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>
wears a stole which is woven from the hair of a goat.
It is nine spans in length and around it are <i>sansûls</i>
(tinsels).</p>

<p>When the gathering comes to an end, they collect
the money from the <i>ḳôchaks</i> and the contractors, and
bring it to the emir. After everyone has taken according
to his rank, the remainder goes to the emir.</p>

<p>They have another gathering which takes place at
the feast of Al-Hijâjj. At this pilgrimage they go
up to the mountain which is called Jabal al-‘Arafât.<a id="FNanchor_56_56" href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>
After remaining there an hour, they hasten toward
Šeiḫ ‘Adî. He who arrives there before his companions
is praised much. Hence everyone tries to
excel. The one who succeeds receives abundant
blessings.</p>

<p>They still have another assembly. This is called
“the road of the <i>ḳôchaks</i>,” when each, putting a rope
around his neck, goes up the mountain. After collecting
wood they bring it to Šeiḫ ‘Adî, carrying it on
their backs. The wood is used for heating purposes
and for the emir’s cooking.</p>

<p>During these assemblies the <i>sanjaḳs</i> are passed
around. In the first place they are washed with water
made sour with sumac in order to be cleansed from
their rust. The water is given away in drinks for
purposes of blessing. In return money is taken. In
the second place, the <i>ḳôchaks</i> go around with the
<i>sanjaḳs</i> to collect money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<p>In their preaching, the šeiḫs tell the people that all
kings have come from their descent, such as Nisroch,<a id="FNanchor_57_57" href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>
who is Nasr-ad-Dîn, and Kamuš who is Faḫr-ad-Dîn,
and Artâmîs, who is Šams-ad-Dîn, and many others,
as Shabur and Yoram; and many royal names of the
ancient kings, together with their own (Yezidi) kings,
are from their seed. The sign of the Yezidi is that he
wears a shirt with a round bosom. It differs from
that of the other people, the bosom of whose shirts
are open all the way down.</p>

<p>There is one occasion when no Yezidi will swear
falsely, viz., when one draws a circle on the ground,
and tells him that this circle belongs to Ṭâ´ûs-Melek,
Šeiḫ ‘Adî, and Yezîd, and <i>baryshabaḳei</i>. He places
him in the middle of the circle, and then tells him that
Melek Ṭâ´ûs and all those who were mentioned above
will not intercede for him after his death, and that
the shirt of the Jewish Nasim<a id="FNanchor_58_58" href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> be on his neck, and
that the hand of Nasim be on his neck and eye, and
that Nasim be his brother for the next world, and let
him be to him for a šeiḫ and a <i>pir</i> if he does not tell
the truth. Then if he swears to tell the truth, he cannot
conceal anything. For an oath made under such
conditions is considered greater than that made in the
name of God, and even than that made in the name
of one of their prophets.</p>

<p>They fast three days in a year from morning till
evening. The fast falls in December, according to the
oriental calendar. They have no prayer<a id="FNanchor_59_59" href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> except what
is mentioned above, such as that referring to the sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
and the moon, and asking help from šeiḫs and holy
places when they say, “O Šeiḫ ‘Adî, O Šeiḫ Sams,”
and the like. They are all forbidden to teach their
children anything, with the exception of two stanzas
which they teach their children out of necessity and
because it is traditional.</p>

<p>A story is told about them by reliable people. Once
when Šeiḫ Naṣir was preaching in a village at Mount
Sinjar, there was a Christian mason in the audience
who, seeing the house filled with people, thought they
were going to pray. He then pretended to take a nap,
that he might amuse himself with what he should hear.
He knew the Kurdish language. When the Christian
seemed to be asleep, but was really awake and listening,
Šeiḫ Naṣir began to preach saying: “Once the
great God appeared to me in vision. He was angry
at Jesus because of a dispute with him. He therefore
caught him and imprisoned him in a den which had no
water. Before the mouth of the den he placed a great
stone. Jesus remained in the den a long time, calling
upon the prophets and the saints for help and asking
their aid. Every one whose succor Jesus asked went
to beg the great God to release him. But God did not
grant their requests. Jesus therefore remained in a
sorrowful state, knowing not what to do.” After this
the preacher remained silent for a quarter of an hour,
and thus a great silence prevailed in the house. Then
he went on to say: “O poor Jesus, why are you so
forgotten, so neglected? Do you not know that all
the prophets and all the saints have no favor with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
the great God unto Melek Ṭâ´ûs? Why have you
forgotten him and have not called upon him?” Saying
this, the preacher again remained silent as before.
Afterward he again continued: “Jesus remained in
the den till one day when he happened to remember
Melek Ṭâ´ûs. He then sought his aid, praying, ‘O
Melek Ṭâ´ûs, I have been in this den for some time.
I am imprisoned; I have sought the help of all the
saints, and none of them could deliver me. Now, save
me from this den.’ When Melek Ṭâ´ûs heard this, he
descended from heaven to earth quicker than the
twinkling of an eye, removed the stone from the top
of the den, and said to Jesus, ‘Come up, behold I have
brought thee out.’ Then both went up to heaven.
When the great God saw Jesus, he said to him, ‘O
Jesus, who brought thee out of the den? Who brought
thee here without my permission?’ Jesus answered and
said, ‘Melek Ṭâ´ûs brought me out of the den and up
here.’ Then God said, ‘Had it been another, I would
have punished him, but Melek Ṭâ´ûs is much beloved
by me; remain here for the sake of my honor.’ So
Jesus remained in heaven.” The preacher added,
“Notice that those who are without do not like Melek
Ṭâ´ûs. Know ye that in the resurrection he will not
like them either, and he will not intercede for them.
But, as for us, he will put us all in a tray, carry us
upon his head, and take us into heaven, while we are
in the tray on his head.” When the congregation heard
this, they rose up, kissed his clothes and feet, and received
his blessing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

<p>Now the views of the Yezidis regarding the birth
of Christ and the explanation of the name of the
Apostle Peter, are found in one of their stories, which
runs thus: “Verily Mary the Virgin mother of Jesus,
begat Jesus in a manner unlike the rest of women.
She begat him from her right side,<a id="FNanchor_60_60" href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> between her
clothes and her body. At that time the Jews had a
custom that, if a woman gave birth, all her relatives
and neighbors would bring her presents. The women
would call, carrying in their right hand a plate of
fruits which were to be found in that season, and in
the left hand they would carry a stone. This custom
was a very ancient one. Therefore when Mary the
Virgin gave birth to Jesus, the wife of Jonah, who is
the mother of Peter, came to her; and, according to
the custom, carried a plate of fruit in her right hand
and a stone in her left. As she entered and gave Mary
the plate, behold, the stone which was in her left hand
begat a male. She called his name Simon Cifa, that is,
son of the stone. Christians do not know these things
as we do.”</p>

<p>They have a story explaining the word heretic. It
is this: When the great God created the heavens, he
put all the keys of the treasuries and the mansions
there in the hands of Melek Ṭâ´ûs, and commanded
him not to open a certain mansion. But he, without
the knowledge of God, opened the house and found a
piece of paper on which was written, “Thou shalt
worship thy God alone, and him alone shalt thou
serve.” He kept the paper with him and allowed no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
one else to know about it. Then God created an iron
ring and hung it in the air between the heaven and
the earth. Afterward he created Adam the first.
Melek Ṭâ´ûs refused to worship Adam when God
commanded him to do so. He showed the written
paper which he took from the mansion and said, “See
what is written here.” Then the great God said, “It
may be that you have opened the mansion which I forbade
you to open.” He answered, “Yes.” Then God
said to him, “You are a heretic, because you have disobeyed
me and transgressed my commandment.”</p>

<p>From this we know that God speaks in the Kurdish
language, that is from the meaning of this saying,
“Go into the iron ring which I, thy God, have made for
whosoever does contrary to my commandment and
disobeys me.”</p>

<p>When one criticizes such a story as this by saying
that God drove Melek Ṭâ´ûs from heaven and sent
him to hell because of his pride before God the most
high, they do not admit that such is the case. They
answer: “Is it possible that one of us in his anger
should drive out his child from his house and let him
wait until the next day before bringing him back?
Of course not. Similar is the relation of the great
God to Melek Ṭâ´ûs. Verily he loves him exceedingly.
You do not understand the books which you read.
The Gospel says, ‘No one ascended up to heaven but
he who came down from heaven.’ No one came down
from heaven but Melek Ṭâ´ûs and Christ. From this
we know that the great God has been reconciled to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
Melek Ṭâ´ûs, who went up to heaven, just as God came
down from heaven and went up again.”</p>

<p>The following is a story told of a <i>kôchak</i>: It is related
that at one time there was no rain in the village
of Ba‘ašîḳa. In this village there was a Yezidi whose
name was Kôchak Berû. There were also some saints
and men of vision dwelling there. They (people)
gathered to ask Berû to see about the rain. He told
them, “Wait till tomorrow that I may see about it.”
They came to him on the next day and said, “What
have you done concerning the question of rain? We
are exceedingly alarmed by reason of its being withheld.”
He answered: “I went up to heaven last night
and entered into the divan where the great God, Šeiḫ
‘Adî, and some other šeiḫs and righteous men were
sitting. The priest Isaac was sitting beside God. The
great God said to me, ‘What do you want, O Kôchak
Berû; why have you come here?’ I said to him, ‘My
lord, this year the rain has been withheld from us till
now, and all thy servants are poor and needy. We
beseech thee to send us rain as thy wont.’ He remained
silent and answered me not. I repeated the
speech twice and thrice, beseeching him. Then I
turned to the šeiḫs who sat there, asking their help
and intercession. The great God answered me, ‘Go
away until we think it over.’ I came down and do not
know what took place after I descended from heaven.
You may go to the priest Isaac and ask him what
was said after I came down.” They went to the priest
and told him the story, and asked him what was said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
after Kôchak Berû came down. This priest Isaac
was a great joker. He answered them, “After the
<i>kôchak</i> came down, I begged God for rain on your
behalf. It was agreed that after six or seven days
he would send it.” They waited accordingly, and by
a strange coincidence, at the end of the period it rained
like a flood for some time. Seeing this, the people
believed in what they were told, and honored the priest
Isaac, looking upon him as one of the saints, and
thinking that he must have Yezidi blood in him. For
more than twenty years this story has been told as
one of the tales of their saints.</p>

<p>Once Šeiḫ ‘Adî bn Musâfir and his <i>murids</i> were
entertained by God in heaven. When they arrived,
they did not find straw for their animals. Therefore
Šeiḫ ‘Adî ordered his <i>murids</i> to carry straw from his
threshing floor on the earth. As it was being transported,
some fell on the way, and has remained as a
sign in heaven unto our day. It is known as the road
of the straw man.</p>

<p>They think that prayer is in the heart; therefore
they do not teach their children about it. And in
their book neither is there any rule regarding prayer,
nor is prayer considered a religious obligation.</p>

<p>Some assert that at one time Šeiḫ ‘Adî, in company
with Šeiḫ ‘Abd-al-ḳâdir, made a pilgrimage to Mecca,
where he remained four years. After his absence
Melek Ṭâ´ûs appeared to them (the two šeiḫs) in his
symbol. He dictated some rules to them and taught
them many things. Then he was hidden from them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
Four years later Šeiḫ ‘Adî returned from Mecca; but
they refused him and would not accept him. They
asserted that he had died or ascended to heaven. He
remained with them, but was without his former respect.
When the time of his death came, Melek Ṭâ´ûs
appeared to them and declared, “This is Šeiḫ ‘Adî
himself, honor him.” Then they honored him and
buried him with due veneration, and made his tomb
a place of pilgrimage. In their estimation it is a more
excellent spot than Mecca. Everyone is under obligation
to visit it once a year at least; and, in addition
to this, they give a sum of money through the šeiḫs
to obtain satisfaction (that Šeiḫ ‘Adî may be pleased
with them). Whoever does this not is disobedient.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is said that the reason why the pilgrimage
to his tomb is regarded as excellent by us and
by God is that in the resurrection Šeiḫ ‘Adî will carry
in a tray all the Yezidis upon his head and take them
into paradise, without requiring them to give account
or answer. Therefore they regard the pilgrimage to
his tomb as a religious duty greater than the pilgrimage
to Mecca.</p>

<p>There are some domes, huts, around the tomb of
Šeiḫ ‘Adî. They are there for the purpose of receiving
blessings from the tomb. And they are all attributed
to the great Šeiḫs, as the hut of ‘Abd-al-ḳâdir-al-Jîlânî;<a id="FNanchor_61_61" href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>
the hut of Šeiḫ ḳadîb-al-Bân; the hut of
Šeiḫ Šams-ad-Dîn; the hut of Šeiḫ Manṣûr-al-Ḥallâj,
and the hut of Šeiḫ Ḫasan-al-Baṣrî. There are also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
some other huts. Each hut has a banner made of
calico. It is a sign of conquest and victory.</p>

<p>Eating of deer’s meat is forbidden them, they say,
because the deer’s eyes resemble the eyes of Šeiḫ ‘Adî.
Verily his virtues are well-known and his praiseworthy
qualities are traditions handed down from generation
to generation. He was the first to accept the Yezidi
religion. He gave them the rules of the religious sect
and founded the office of the ṣeiḫ. In addition to this,
he was renowned for his devotion and religious exercise.
From Mount Lališ, he used to hear the preaching
of ‘Abd-al-ḳâdir-al-Jîlâni in Bagdad. He used
to draw a circle on the ground and say to the religious
ones, “Whosoever wants to hear the preaching of Al-Jîlânî,
let him enter within this circle.” The following
custom, which we have, began with him: If we wish
to swear to anyone, a ṣeiḫ draws a circle, and he who
is to take an oath, enters into it.</p>

<p>At one time, passing by a garden, Šeiḫ ‘Adî asked
about lettuce; and, as no one answered, he said,
“Huss” (hush). For this reason lettuce is forbidden
and not eaten.</p>

<p>As regards fasting, they say about the month of
Ramaḍân that it was dumb and deaf. Therefore,
when God commanded the Moslems to fast, he likewise
commanded the Yezidis, saying to them in the
Kurdish language, “<i>sese</i>,” meaning “three.” The
Mohammedans did not understand it; they took it for
“<i>se</i>,” “thirty.” For this reason, they (Yezidis) fast
three days. Moreover, they believe there are eating,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
drinking, and other earthly pleasures in the next
world.<a id="FNanchor_62_62" href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> Some hold that the rule of heaven is in God’s
hands, but the rule of the earth is in Šeiḫ ‘Adî’s hands.
Being exceedingly beloved by God, he bestowed upon
him according to ‘Adî’s desire.</p>

<p>They believe in the transmigration of souls. This
is evinced by the fact that when the soul of Manṣûr-al-Ḥallâj
parted from his body when the Caliph of
Bagdad killed him and cast his head into the water,
his soul floated on the water. By a wonderful chance
and a strange happening, the sister of the said Manṣûr
went to fill her jar. The soul of her brother entered it.
Without knowing what had happened, she came with
it to the house. Being tired, she felt thirsty and drank
from the jar. At that moment the soul of her brother
entered her, but she did not perceive it until she became
pregnant. She gave birth to a son who resembled
Šeiḫ Manṣûr himself. He became her brother according
to birth and her son according to imputation. The
reason why they do not use drinking-vessels which
have narrow mouths, or a net-like cover, is that when
one drinks water from them they make a sound. When
the head of Šeiḫ Manṣûr was thrown into the water
it gurgled. In his honor they do not use the small
jars with narrow necks.</p>

<p>They assert that they expect a prophet who will
come from Persia to annul the law of Mohammed and
abrogate Islam. They believe that there are seven
gods, and that each god administers the universe for
ten thousand years; and that one of these gods is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
Lasiferos, the chief of the fallen angels, who bears
also the name Melek Ṭâ´ûs. They make him a graven
image after the form of a cock<a id="FNanchor_63_63" href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> and worship it. They
play the tambourine and dance before it to make it
rejoice with them. They (<i>ḳawwâls</i>) travel within the
Yezidis’ villages to collect money, at which time they
take it into the houses that it may bless and honor
them. Some say that Šeiḫ ‘Adî is a deity; others that he
is like a Vizier to God. To him all things are referred.
This is Melek Ṭâ´ûs age. The ruling and administrative
power is in his hands until the thousandth year.
When the time comes to an end he will deliver the
power to the next god to rule and administer until
another thousand years shall be ended, and so on until
the seventh god. And yet there is accord and love
among these gods, and none is jealous of the one who
may rule and administer the world for a period of
ten thousand years. They have a book named Al
Jilwah that they ascribe to Šeiḫ ‘Adî, and they suffer
no one who is not one of them to read it.</p>

<p>Mention is made in some of their books that the
First Cause is the Supreme God, who before he created
this world, was enjoying himself over the seas;<a id="FNanchor_64_64" href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> and
in his hand was a great White Pearl, with which he
was playing. Then he resolved to cast it into the sea,
and when he did so this world came into being.</p>

<p>Moreover, they think themselves not to be of the
same seed from which the rest of mankind sprung,
but that they are begotten of the son of Adam, who
was born to Adam of his spittle. For this reason they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
imagine themselves nobler and more pleasing to the
gods than others.</p>

<p>They say they have taken fasting and sacrifice from
Islam; baptism from Christians; prohibition of foods
from the Jews; their way of worship from the idolaters;
dissimulation of doctrine from the Rafiḍis
(Shi‘ites); human sacrifice and transmigration from
the pre-Islamic paganism of the Arabs and from the
Sabians. They say that when the spirit of man goes
forth from his body, it enters into another man if it
be just; but if unjust, into an animal.</p>

<h3 id="SEVEN_CLASSES_OF_YEZIDIS">SEVEN CLASSES OF YEZIDIS</h3>


<p>They are divided into seven classes, and each class
has functions peculiar to itself that cannot be discharged
by any of the other classes. They are:</p>

<p>1. Šeiḫ. He is the servant of the tomb, and a descendant
of Imam Ḥasan al-Baṣrî. No one can give a
legal decision or sign any document except the šeiḫ
who is the servant of Šeiḫ ‘Adî’s tomb. He has a
sign by which he is distinguished from others. The
sign is a belt which he puts on his body, and net-like
gloves, which resemble the halters of camels. If he
goes among his people, they bow down and pay him
their respects. The šeiḫs sell a place in paradise to
anyone who wishes to pay money.</p>

<p>2. Emir. The emirship specifically belongs to the
descendants of Yezîd. They have a genealogical tree,
preserved from their fathers and forefathers, which
goes up to Yezîd himself. The emirs have charge of
the temporal and governmental affairs, and have the
right to say, “Do this and do not that.”</p>

<p>3. ḳawwâl. He has charge of tambourines and
flutes and religious hymns.</p>

<p>4. Pîr. To him appertain the conduct of fasts, the
breaking of fasts, and hair-dressing.</p>

<p>5. Kôchak. To him appertain the duties of religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
instruction, and sepulture, and interpretation of
dreams, i. e., prophecy.</p>

<p>6. Faḳîr. To him appertain the duties of instruction
of boys and girls in playing on the tambourines,
in dancing and religious pleasure. He serves Šeiḫ ‘Adî.</p>

<p>7. Mulla. To him appertain the duties of instructing
children. He guards the books and the mysteries
of religion and attends to the affairs of the sect.</p>

<h4 id="ARTICLES_OF_FAITH">ARTICLES OF FAITH</h4>


<p>At one time (A. H. 1289; A. D. 1872), the Ottoman
power wanted to draft from among them an army
instead of taking the tax which was its due. They
presented to the government all the rules that prevented
them from complying. These all pertain to
religion and are moral obligations upon them. They
are as follows:</p>


<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Article I</span></p>

<p>According to our Yezidi religion every member of
our sect, whether big or little, girl or woman, must
visit Melek Ṭâ´ûs three times a year, that is, first, from
the beginning to the last of the month of April, Roman
calendar; secondly, from the beginning to the end of
the month of September; thirdly, from the beginning
to the end of the month of November. If anyone visit
not the image of Melek Ṭâ´ûs, he is an infidel.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Article II</span></p>

<p>If any member of our sect, big or little, visit not his
highness Šeiḫ ‘Adî bn Musâfir—may God sanctify his
mysteries! once a year, i. e., from the fifteenth to the
twentieth of the month of September, Roman calendar,
he is an infidel according to our religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Article III</span></p>

<p>Every member of our sect must visit the place of the
sunrise every day when it appears, and there should
not be Moslem, nor Christian, nor any one else in that
place. If any one do this not, he is an infidel.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Article IV</span></p>

<p>Every member of our sect must daily kiss the hand
of his brother, his brother of the next world, namely,
the servant of the Mahdi, and the hand of his šeiḫ
or <i>pîr</i>. If any one do this not, he is regarded as an
infidel.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Article V</span></p>

<p>According to our religion it is something intolerable
when the Moslem in the morning begins to say in
prayer, God forbid! “I take refuge in God, etc.”<a id="FNanchor_67_67" href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> If
any one of us hear it, he must kill the one who says it
and kill himself; otherwise he becomes an infidel.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Article VI</span></p>

<p>When one of our sect is on the point of death, if
there be no brother of the next world and his šeiḫ, or
his <i>pîr</i> and one of the <i>ḳawwâls</i> with him to say three
sayings over him, viz., “O servant of Melek Ṭâ´ûs,
whose ways are high, you must die in the religion of
the one we worship, who is Melek Ṭâ´ûs, whose ways
are high, and do not die in any other religion than his.
And if some one should come and say to you something
from the Mohammedan religion, or Christian
religion, or Jewish religion, or some other religion, do
not believe him, and do not follow him. And if you
believe and follow another religion than that of the
one we worship, Melek Ṭâ´ûs, you shall die an infidel,”
he becomes an infidel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Article VII</span></p>

<p>We have something called the blessing of Šeiḫ ‘Adî,
that is, the dust of the tomb Šeiḫ ‘Adî—may God sanctify
his mystery! Every member of our sect must
have some of it with him in his pocket and eat of it
every morning. And if he eat not of it intentionally,
he is an infidel. Likewise at the time of death, if he
possess not some of that dust intentionally, he dies
an infidel.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Article VIII</span></p>

<p>Regarding our fasting, if any one of our sect wish
to fast, he must fast in his own place, not in another.
For while fasting he must go every morning to the
house of his šeih and his <i>pîr</i>, and there he must begin
to fast; and when he breaks his fast, likewise, he must
go to the house of his šeih and his <i>pîr</i>, and there break
the fast by drinking the holy wine of the šeih or the
<i>pîr</i>. And if he drink not two or three glasses of that
wine, his fasting is not acceptable, and he becomes
an infidel.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Article IX</span></p>

<p>If one of our sect go to another place and remain
there as much as one year, and afterward return to his
place, then his wife is forbidden him, and none of us
will give him a wife. If anyone give him a wife, that
one is an infidel.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Article X</span></p>

<p>Regarding our dress, as we have mentioned in the
fourth Article that every one of our sect has a brother
for the next world, he has also a sister for the next
world.<a id="FNanchor_68_68" href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> Therefore if any one of us make for himself
a new shirt, it is necessary that his sister for the next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
world should open its neck band, i. e., the neck band of
that shirt, with her hand. And if she open it not with
her hand, and he wear it, then he is an infidel.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Article XI</span></p>

<p>If some one of our sect make a shirt or a new dress,
he cannot wear it without baptizing it in the blessed
water which is to be found at the shrine of his highness
Šeiḫ ‘Adî, may God sanctify his mystery! If he wear
it, he is an infidel.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Article XII</span></p>

<p>We may not wear a light black dress at all. We
may not comb our heads with the comb of a Moslem
or a Christian or a Jew or any other. Nor may we
shave our heads with the razor used by any other
than ourselves (Yezidis), except it be washed in the
blessed water which is to be found at the shrine of his
highness Šeih ‘Adî. Then it is lawful for us to shave
our heads. But if we shave our heads without the
razor having been washed in that water, we become
infidels.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Article XIII</span></p>

<p>No Yezidi may enter the water-closet of a Moslem,
or take a bath at a Moslem’s house, or eat with a

on which all creatures pass for judgment before the
Creator. On this day three books are opened, wherein
the fate of the wicked, the righteous, and those of the
intermediate class are recorded. Hence prayer and
works of repentance are performed at the New Year
from the first to the tenth days, that an unfavorable
decision might be averted; cf. <i>Jewish Encyclopedia</i>,

church of this monastery is a large building, chiefly
interesting as containing the tomb of the great Bar
Hebraeus, known as Abu-l-Faraj, who was ordained
at Tripolis, and became in 1246 A. D. Metropolitan
of Mosul. He lies buried, with his brother Barsom,
in the “Beth ḳadišeh” (sanctuary) of the church, and
over them is placed the inscription: “This is the grave

<small><span class="smcap">The Religious Origin of the Yezidis</span></small></h3>


<p>The origin of the devil-worshippers has been the
subject of much controversy; but aside from an
expression of views, no satisfactory solution of the
problem has as yet been reached. The different theories
which have been advanced may be classified under
four general heads: The Myth of the Yezidis themselves;
the tradition of Eastern Christians; the dogmatic
idea of the Mohammedan scholars; and the
speculative theory of the western orientalists.</p>


<h4>I<br />

<small><span class="smcap">The Yezidi Myth</span></small></h4>

<p>The Myth of the Yezidis concerning their origin
may be derived from three different sources: from
their sacred book, from the appendix of the manuscript,
and from actual conversation of travellers
with them or with natives dwelling among them. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
noticeable fact is that this tradition assumes the
religion of the sect as existing long before the time of
their chief saint, Šeiḫ ‘Adî. Al-Jilwah begins with
the statement that Melek Ṭâ´ûs sent his servant, <i>i. e.</i>,
the Yezidis, that they might not go astray. Starting
from this assumption, the writer of the revealed book
goes on to trace the origin of the “elect” to the very
beginning of human history. He asserts that from
the start God created them as a peculiar people of
‘Azazil, <i>i. e.</i>, Melek-Ṭâ´ûs. In the main, this idea
finds expression in the oral traditions. But here we
have a mass of material so clouded by superstition
and ignorance that it is next to impossible to come to
any conclusion as to the history of this interesting
people. One point the myth repeatedly emphasizes,
as an explanation of the origin of the sect, is that it
was descended from Adam alone; while the other
sects were descended from Adam and Eve. For this
reason, the same tradition implies, the Yezidis are
nobler than the others. But how they have come to
be such unique descendants is a question not easily
answered. One account has it that when Adam and
Eve disputed as to the generation of the human race,
each claiming to be the sole begetter of the race, they
finally agreed to put their seed in separate jars and
seal them with their own seals. After nine months
they opened the jars, and in Adam’s jar they found
two children, a male and a female. From these two
the Yezidis were descended. Another explanation is
that from Adam’s essence was born Šeher bn Jebr,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
of whom nothing is known; and of him, a separate
community, which is the sect of Melek Ṭâ´ûs. We
have, moreover, the tradition that the Yezidis are
descendants of a son born to Adam of his spittle.
Now whether this son be identical with Šeher bn Jebr
is not certain. Writing in one of the oriental periodicals,
an eastern scholar quotes a Yezidi šeiḫ in
a statement which seems to corroborate the tradition
that the Yezidis are a noble progeny of Adam; but the
quotation differs from the instance previously cited in
stating that the quarrel which took place between
Adam and Eve led to their separation to places distant
from each other a journey of forty days.<a id="FNanchor_71_71" href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> There, it
is said, Adam miraculously gave birth to a son. Distressed
by this incident, Eve asked God that she might
find favor in her husband’s eyes by giving birth to a
child. Thereupon, it continues, she begot a very
pretty daughter. Attracted by her beauty, Adam
married her to his son. Now, the Yezidis, we are
told, are the blessed seed of these two children.<a id="FNanchor_72_72" href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p>Not only when the tradition, tracing the origin of
the Yezidis as a race, asserts that, as a religious body,
they come from a very ancient time; but also when
it speaks of them as a nation, it points out their
antiquity. On this latter, as well as on the former
point, their book and their oral tradition agree. The
Yezidis are said to have sprung from a noble personage,
the King of Peace, whose name was Na-‘umi,
but whom they now call Melek-Miran.<a id="FNanchor_73_73" href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> The rest of
mankind, however, are from the seed of Ham, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
mocked his father. Whom they signified by Na-‘umi
or Miran it is hard to say; but it is likely that they
regard him as one of the other two sons of Noah.
They claim also that the ancient Assyrian kings were
members of their race, and that some of the Persian,
Roman and Jewish kings were appointed for them by
Melek Ṭâ´ûs. They likewise seem to trace their origin
to the prophets and other personages of the Old Testament;
as Seth, Enoch, Noah, etc. Their religion
furthermore, they assert, antedates Christ.<a id="FNanchor_74_74" href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>There is still another tradition that traces the devil-worshippers
to a different origin. I refer to the statement
which Masehaf Reš makes regarding Mu‘awiya,
Mohammed’s servant.<a id="FNanchor_75_75" href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> Mu‘awiya was asked by his
master to shave his head. While performing the duty,
he cut the prophet’s scalp, and began to lick the bleeding
spot. When he was told that this act would result
in his giving birth to a nation which would oppose the
followers of his master, Mu‘awiya declared that he
would not marry. He was afterwards, however,
bitten by a serpent, and was told that he would die
unless he married. He therefore consented to marry,
but chose an old woman in order not to have children.
But she miraculously became a young woman of
twenty-five. And from her the God Yezid was born.
The story, of course, is a myth, and it is of such a
nature that no historic fact can be derived from it.
It is further complicated by the fact that this Yezid
is identified with Melek Ṭâ´ûs; and, in another myth,
is represented in form as being half angel and half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
man and as remaining a bachelor long after the marriage
of Adam. He was, however, finally possessed
of a desire to marry, and, unable to marry a mortal’s
daughter, being himself half angel, sought the assistance
of Melek Ṭâ´ûs, who presented to him an ḥouri,
and from this union there sprang a pious people, the
Yezidis.</p>

<p>But the devil-worshippers have still another story,
which goes to show that Yezid bn Mu‘awiya is not
their founder. This myth asserts that they are the
progeny of Adam’s son who was married to Eve’s
daughter; that the descendants continued worshipping
God and Melek Ṭâ´ûs without bringing a foreign
element into their religion; and that, at first, the sect
did not bear the name Yezidis, which, in their own
opinion, is a comparatively new appellative. As to
how they came to be called by this new name, it is
explained that when, in the course of time, some
corruption entered the Yezidi religion, there arose a
certain Calif by the name of Yezid who wrought
miracles. Since then, his followers have been called
Yezidis. This Yezid, it is said, is the son of
Mu‘awiya bn Sufian, and his mother was of Christian
origin. To accomplish his desire, bn Mu‘awiya went
to Šeiḫ ‘Adi, who was a learned and devout but cunning
person, and had instituted a religious innovation.
Yezid, the tradition continues, learned ‘Adi’s religion
and taught it to his followers; and, from that time on,
the sect came to be called after him.<a id="FNanchor_76_76" href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> But while
some, considering this legend as authoritative, ven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>erate
the man bearing the name, others deny all
connection with him.<a id="FNanchor_77_77" href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p>The testimony of some travellers offers another
explanation of the origin of the sect in question, an
account which has perhaps more historical significance
than the preceding theories. It is stated that the
Yezidis have a tradition to the effect that they came
from Baṣrah and from the country watered by the
lower part of the Euphrates; that after their emigration
they first settled in Syria, and subsequently took
possession of the Sinjar Hill and the district now
inhabited in Kurdistan. As to the date of their settlement
in Mesopotamia, no positive information can be
obtained. Some scholars infer that it took place about
the time of Tamerlane, toward the end of the fourteenth
century.<a id="FNanchor_78_78" href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> It is related that the devil-worshippers
hold that, among their own number, the ancient
name for God is Azd, and from it the name of the
sect is derived;<a id="FNanchor_79_79" href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> that the conviction that they are
Yezidis, <i>i. e.</i>, God’s people, has been their consolation
and comfort through the ages in their tribulations;<a id="FNanchor_80_80" href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
and that they have taken many religious observances
from different bodies—Mohammedans, Christians,
Jews, Pagan Arabs, Shiites, and Sabaians.</p>

<p>Besides these different explanations of the origin of
the devil-worshippers as descendants of Adam, of
Yezid bn Mu‘awiya, as being of the colony from the
north, as taking their name from Azd, God, there is
another account. I refer to a myth which is current
among the people of Seistan, an eastern province of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
Persia, where there are a considerable number of these
Shaitan parasts (devil worshippers):</p>

<p>“In former times there existed a prophet named
Ḥanalalah, whose life was prolonged to the measure
of a thousand years. He was their ruler and benefactor;
and as by his agency, their flocks gave birth
to lambs and kids miraculously once a week, though
ignorant of the use of money, they, with much gratitude
to him, procured all the comforts of life. At
length, however, he died, and was succeeded by his
son, whom Šatan, presuming on his inexperience,
tempted to sin by entering a large mulberry tree, when
he addressed the successor of Ḥanalalah, and called
on him to worship the prince of darkness. Astonished,
yet unshaken, the youth resisted the temptation. But
the miracle proved too much for the constancy of his
flock, who now began to turn to the worship of the
devil. The young prophet, enraged at this, seized an
axe and a saw, and prepared to cut down the tree.
He was arrested in this by the appearance of a
human being, who exclaimed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span> ‘Rash boy, desist!
Turn to me and let us wrestle for the victory. If you
conquer, then fell the tree.’</p>

<p>“The prophet contended and vanquished his opponent,
who, however, bought his own safety and that
of the tree by the promise of a large weekly treasure.
After seven days the holy victor again visited the tree
to claim the gold or fell it to the ground; but Satan
persuaded him to hazard another struggle on the
promise that, if he conquered again, the amount
should be doubled. This second encounter proved
fatal to the youth. He was put to death by his
spiritual antagonist, and the result confirmed the
tribes over whom he had ruled in their worship of the
tree and its tutelary demon.”<a id="FNanchor_81_81" href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>According to this legend, the Šatan parasts are the
victims of their young prophet who, as long as he was
actuated by a disinterested zeal for religion, was
victorious over the principle of evil; but failed as
soon as that zeal gave place to a sordid cupidity for
earthly treasure.</p>

<p>I have dwelt upon the superstitious theories of the
Yezidis themselves regarding their religious origin,
not because these theories have an importance in
themselves, but because of their bearing upon the
views advanced by modern scholars. The scholars
have based their theories on some of these conflicting
stories without sufficient criticism. I shall dwell upon
this more at length later on.</p>


<h4>II<br />

<small><span class="smcap">The Christian Tradition</span></small></h4>

<p>But the myth of the Yezidis is not the only account
that attempts to trace their religious origin; the eastern
Christians have a tradition that gives a different
interpretation. It is to the effect that the people in
question were originally Christians, but that ignorance
brought them into their present condition. The tradi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>tion
runs that the shrine of Šeiḫ ‘Adi was formerly a
Nestorian monastery which was noted for the devotion
of its monks, but that these were tempted by the
devil and left their convent. The Church of the
Monastery was dedicated to St. Thaddeus or Addai,<a id="FNanchor_82_82" href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a>
one of the seventy-two disciples who, after the ascension
of our Lord, was sent to King Abgar of Edessa.
It is said that the temple of ‘Adi has a conventicle
resembling that at Jerusalem.<a id="FNanchor_83_83" href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> The story of how the
cloister was deserted is as follows:</p>

<p>On a great feast day, while the hermits bearing the
cross went in procession around the church, they
saw, hanging on a tree, a piece of paper with this
inscription: “O ye devout monks! Let it be known
to you that God has forgiven all your sins, great and
small; cease to undergo religious exercises; leave your
hermitage; disperse, marry and rear children. Peace
be unto you!” On the second day they observed the
same thing, and were led to dispute among themselves
whether this were a device of God or of a devil.
When on the third day the same incident was
repeated, they agreed to leave the abbey and follow
what seemed to them a divine order. Šeiḫ ‘Adi, the
legend goes on, had foretold to the Yezidis of that
district that the monks of this monastery would desert
their place, would become Yezidis, would marry and
beget children; that he would die during that time;
and that he wishes his followers to pull down the
altar of the church in that priory and bury him there.
Shortly after the fulfilment of his prophecy, the Šeiḫ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
died, and was entombed in the place of the altar. And
since that time, it is asserted, the spot has become the
sanctuary of the devil-worshippers. In support of
this statement, it is argued, that there was a Syriac
inscription in the temple mentioning the name of the
founder of the monastery and the patriarch in whose
time it was built; that some of the Yezidis themselves
bear testimony to this fact, and say they have removed
the writing from its former place and have hidden it
at the entrance to ‘Adi’s temple, a spot the whereabouts
of which only a few of them know. The
reason why this record is hidden, it is explained, is
the fear that the Nestorians may see it and reclaim
the church.<a id="FNanchor_84_84" href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<p>Such is the eastern Christian’s tradition relative
to the origin of the Yezidis. It is, of course, merely
a legend; but its character is such as to require careful
examination and critical study. It may embody a
measure of truth that will indirectly throw some light
on the subject in hand.</p>

<p>One noticeable thing regarding this current view is
that it is not a recent invention; else it might be said
to be the creation of ignorance at a time far removed
from the event which it records. Assemani, himself
an oriental of distinguished scholarship, in that part
of his book wherein he treats of the religion of
Mesopotamia, according to the natives of the country,
says that the Yezidis were at one time Christians, who,
however, in the course of time, had forgotten the
fundamental principles of their faith.<a id="FNanchor_85_85" href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> This state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>ment
is incorporated in the writings of all western
orientals that have travelled in the East.<a id="FNanchor_86_86" href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>Another thing worthy of notice is that the Christians
should have such a sacred regard for his tradition
as to hand it down to posterity at the risk of their
own reputation. Certainly the Christians are not
cherishing this theory with any expectation of receiving
honor by assuming relation with the Yezidis.
The devil-worshippers are utterly despised by all their
neighbors. Nor do they do it out of love, that they
may arouse the sympathy of the dominating race for
this degraded people. Oriental Christians themselves
despise the Yezidi sect. They would not, and could
not, help them. There must then be some truth in a
legend that leads the church to regard a despised
people as having been at one time co-religionists.</p>

<p>Were the antiquity of the tradition, and the unfavorable
result which its entertainment causes, the
only two reasons for its consideration, we might just
as well dismiss it. But there are other things which
go to point out some historic facts underlying the current
theory. One such fact is that the family name
of the Yezidis around Mosul is Daseni, plur Dawasen.
The Christians and the Mohammedans know them by
this name, and they themselves also use it, and say
it is the ancient name of their race, existing from
time immemorial.<a id="FNanchor_87_87" href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> Now Daseni, or Dasaniyat, was
the name of a Nestorian Diocese, the disappearance of
which is simultaneous with the appearance of the
Yezidis in these places.<a id="FNanchor_88_88" href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

<p>It is stated, moreover, that all the people of Sinjar
were formerly Christians, belonging to the ancient
Syriac Church and having a very prominent diocese,
which was called the diocese of Šaki, <i>i. e.</i>, Sinjar; and
that the diocese continued to exist till the middle of
the eighteenth century: What goes to verify this tradition
is that, at present, there is a library at Jabal
Sinjar, under the control of the Yezidis, that consists
of ancient Syriac books. They are kept in a small
room guarded by a Yezidi. On Sunday and Friday
of every week they burn incense and light lamps in
honor of the manuscripts; and once a month they take
them out in the sun to dust and to preserve them from
destruction by dampness. After the door is locked,
the key is kept by the Šeiḫ, besides whom and his son
no one else is allowed to touch the books. What is
more interesting, the people of Sinjar say they have
inherited the library from their forefathers, who were
Christians.<a id="FNanchor_89_89" href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> It is pointed out, furthermore, that the
names of the principal towns of the Yezidis are
Syriac. Ba‘šika comes from “the house of the
falsely accused, or oppressed”; Ba‘adrie from “the
place of help or refuge”; Baḥzanie from “the house
of visions or inspiration”; Talḥas from “the hill of
suffering,” where many Christians were martyred by
Persians. These are a few of many Yezidi villages
having Syriac names.</p>

<p>The Yezidis have religious practices which are to
be found only in the Christian Church. I mean the
rites of baptism and the Eucharist. It is true that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
the use of water as a rite is practised by other non-Christian
sects, such as the Mandeans; but it is
argued that this ordinance as observed by the Yezidis
is so similar to that of the Christians that its origin is
to be traced back to Christianity, rather than to any
other system. Like their neighbors, the Dawaseni
must if possible baptize their children at the earliest
age. In performing the rite, the Šeiḫ, like the Christian
priest, puts his hand upon the child’s head. In
regard to the sacrament of the Lord’s supper, it is
strictly Christian in character. The Yezidis call the
cup the cup of Isa (Jesus); and when a couple marry,
they go to a Christian town to partake of Al-ḳiddas
(the Eucharist) from the hand of a priest, a custom
which prevails among eastern Christians. What
requires special note is that this practice is observed
where the Yezidi influence is not very strong, a fact
which seems to indicate that the Apostate Nasara,
who lived remote from strongly Yezidising influences,
were able to retain some of their originally much favored
practices, and vice versa.<a id="FNanchor_90_90" href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p>Finally, the Dawaseni entertain great reverence for
Christianity and the Christian saints. They respect
the churches and tombs of the Christians, and kiss the
doors and walls when they enter them; but they never
visit a Mohammedan mosque. In the Black Book a
statement is made that on her way to the house of
her bridegroom, a bride should visit the temple of
every idol she passes by, even if it be a Christian
Church.<a id="FNanchor_91_91" href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> They have also professed reverence for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
‘Isa (Jesus). They affect more attachment to An-Naṣara
than to Mohammedans. Such a religious
affinity cannot be fully accounted for on any other
ground than that of their sincere respect for Christianity,
a feeling which clearly indicates that these
people must at one time have had a very close connection
with Christianity. This intimate relation
cannot be explained by their ignorance, or by kindred
experiences, as some scholars seem to think.<a id="FNanchor_92_92" href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> It is
true the Christians have been co-sufferers with them;
both have lived for generations under the same yoke
of bondage and oppression and under similar circumstances.
But this alone could not create sympathy
between them. Such an assumption cannot be verified
by the facts collected through our observation of
the Yezidis’ character as a religious body. They are
sincere in their beliefs, and never compromise in
religious matters. History has shown again and again
that they have suffered martyrdom for their faith, in
which they have been as sincere and unshaken as have
been the heroes of any religion. No matter how uneducated
they may be, they are not hypocrites in their
faith. The theory is also refuted by our understanding
of the nature of the affinity in question between
the Yezidis and the Christians. It is not a matter of
sympathy but of religion. They believe in some
forms of Christianity; and when they visit a church,
they want to exercise their faith and not to express
their sympathy. What is more, the eastern Christians
have no sympathy for the devil worshippers, at least,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
not more than they have for any other religious body.
Such an affinity is wanting between the Jews and the
Christians or the Yezidis, yet they all live under the
same conditions.</p>

<p>I am not here advocating the theory, or implying,
that the Yezidi sect is a corrupt form of Christianity,
but am simply aiming to show that if the similarity
of a certain religion with another in some phases be
taken as a ground for the explanation of its origin,
the Christian tradition can be regarded as a more
probable theory to account for the rise of Yezidism
than any other view: And, hence, to point out, what
seems to me to be the best position, that the explanation
must be found ultimately in some historical document
which will give us a reasonable clew in the
tracing of the sect in question to its founder.</p>




<h4>III<br />

<small><span class="smcap">The Speculative Theories of Western
Orientalists</span></small></h4>


<p>Thus far we have been dealing with the different
theories regarding the origin of the Yezidis held in
the East: the myth of the devil-worshippers themselves,
the Christian tradition. Now we turn our
attention to the West, which also has expressed itself
on this subject. The degree of interest shown in this
particular case, however, differs with different
nationalities. The English-speaking scholars come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
first; next come the French; then the Russians; and
finally the Italians. The German scholars seem to be
interested mainly in certain words and festive events.
And, in the discussion of these, they go so far in their
unbounded speculation that one cannot tell whether
the people they deal with are the Yezidis in question,
Assyrians, Babylonians, Canaanites, Greeks, Romans
or Jews. The German writers do not seem to be
interested so much in the problem of the origin of this
people as a sect, unless they regard the question as
settled on the ground of the Yezidis’ own statement
that they are the descendants of Yezid bn Mu‘awiya.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, the rise of the interest in the
inquiry about the founder of this sect on a scientific
basis, is due, without question, to the scholarship of
the West. And any solution of the problem (and it
does not matter who does the work), in the last
analysis, must be accredited to the influences emanating
from these scholars and these scholars only.
Nevertheless modern orientalists have been far from
approaching the solution of the question. This may
be due in part to the extreme interest which they
have taken in the matter, an interest which led them
to accept the phenomena without critical examination.
But the inductive study of their respective writings
tends to show that this is due to their method of procedure
rather than to anything else. They have employed
the philosophical and not the historical
method.<a id="FNanchor_93_93" href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> I do not mean to deny the value of such
a course of investigation in questions pertaining to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
religion, but what I do mean to say is that the method
of the scholars in question is almost purely speculative,
and they do not seem to appeal to historical facts
in support of their assumptions. The inevitable consequence
has been, therefore, that in their theories
there exists an uncertainty and indefiniteness that
puzzles the student of history.</p>

<p>Another fact which the inductive study of the views
of the western scholars reveals is that their theories
are nothing more nor less than the expression of the
Yezidis’ tradition in terms of modern scholarship,
without, however, the showing of reasons for so doing.
This fact will be proved presently when we shall
examine their respective writings.</p>

<p>Western orientalists are divided into three schools
of opinion on the question of the religious origin of
the Yezidis. There are those who hold that the sect
takes its rise from Yezid bn Mu‘awiya. This view is
advocated by a modern writer, who says, “The Arabs
who accepted Mohammed called those who did not
Al-jahaleen, <i>i. e.</i>, the ignorant ones. Among the latter
was Yezid bn Mu‘awiya who refused to accompany
Mu‘awiya, his father, as an attendant upon his person.
Many of the ignorant ones rallied around Yezid, and
he became the nucleus of the sect that appropriated
his name. The Yezidis possess a genealogical tree by
means of which they trace their religious origin back
to him.”<a id="FNanchor_94_94" href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<p>Now, the ground for this assertion, the writer does
not give; he is entirely silent as to the source of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
information. It is evident, therefore, that he is
regarding the superstitious theory of the Yezidis as a
fact without making any reflection upon it. He also
seems to be confusing this Yezid with his uncle of
the same name, who, with Mu‘awiya his brother came
in company with their father Abu Sofian, to Mohammed
to receive presents from the Prophet. But
the Arab historians tell us that not only Abu Sofian
and each of his two sons received a hundred camels
but that they were each presented with forty ounces
of silver.<a id="FNanchor_95_95" href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<p>Then, too, many scholars deny that the name
Yezidis is the original appellation. Some assert it was
put upon them by the Mohammedans as a term of
reproach.<a id="FNanchor_96_96" href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> Others maintain that the sect adopted the
name Yezid, son of Mu‘awiya to secure toleration at
the hands of the Mohammedans.<a id="FNanchor_97_97" href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> But the scholar
quoted may entertain the view of those who say that
the Yezidis are really the followers of Ibn Mu‘awiya;
but that they deny it for fear of persecution on the
part of Shiites. These latter hate Yezid, because he
murdered ‘Ali’s son, Husein, who is regarded by them
as their true Imam. This inference is founded on the
theory that the Mohammedans of Persia consider the
people in question as descendants of the Calif whose
name is odious to them.<a id="FNanchor_98_98" href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> But it is not certain that
the followers of ‘Ali entertain such a view regarding
the origin of the Yezidis. And, if they do, they have
no historical facts to justify them in their opinion.
Their hatred of the sect can be better explained on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
the basis of the relation of the devil-worshippers to
Yezid bn Unaisa. For he was one of those who most
bitterly hated ‘Ali; see pp. <a href='#Page_121'>121</a>, <a href='#Page_122'>122</a>, <a href='#Page_128'>128</a> of this book.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the theory of this school is neutralized
by the fact that none of the Arab historians mentions
the son of the first Calif in the Omayyid
dynasty as a founder of any heretical sect. On the
contrary, they all agree that he was not only a
Mohammedan but a successor of the prophet, being
the second calif in the Omayyid dynasty. Ibn
Ḫallikan mentions his name two or three times, and
says that his works were collected. He says nothing,
however, as to his founding any religious schism.</p>

<p>There is still another school among the western
orientalists. I mean those who hold that the religion
of the devil-worshippers is of Persian origin. They
are of two wings. There are those who take their
method of procedure from the name Yezid or Yazd.
They argue that this term in Persian, Yazd (pla
Yazdān), Avestan Yezata, ‘worthy of worship’, means
God, or good spirit, over against Ahriman, the evil
principle. Hence, the name Yezid, according to them,
indicates the people that believe in this good god. To
the objection that the Yezidis worship the evil spirit,
answer is made that Yezid Ferfer is the name of the
attendant of the evil spirit among the Parsees.<a id="FNanchor_99_99" href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>
Others believe that the word “Yezid” signifies God.
It indicates in the plural the observers of superstitious
doctrines as may be seen by the idol Yezid, which the
Bishop of Nagham overthrew.<a id="FNanchor_100_100" href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> Still others say that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
in the tradition of these people Yezid must have been
an abbreviated form of Aez-da-Khuda, that is, created
of God. In support of this theory, it is claimed that
in reality the Yezidis worship God and not the devil.
It is thought by many, too, that the Yezidis derive
their name from Yazd, or Yezid, a name of a town
in Central Persia, of which the Parsees form the
principal part of the inhabitants.[101]</p>

<p>The other wing of the second school attempts to
trace the origin of the devil-worshippers to a Persian
source on the basis of certain resemblances between
the two religions. Conspicuous among the representatives
of this school is Professor A. V. Jackson, of
Columbia University. This distinguished scholar is
considered an eminent authority on Iranian religions,
and particularly an eye-witness authority on the
Yezidi question. His views, therefore, not only
deserve careful consideration, but they demand their
full share in solving such an important problem as the
one under discussion. I have preferred his discussion
of this theory to that of others because he has expressed
himself clearly and consistently and without
rendering himself liable to misapprehension on the
part of the reader. Briefly stated, Dr. Jackson’s
position is as follows: “The Yezidis may actually
show some surviving traces of old devil-worship in
Mazandaran, which Zoroaster anathematized so bitterly,”
and “some old reminiscences of common
Iranian faith.” To verify this hypothesis, he proceeds
to point out many instances. One example he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
cites is that “the Yezidis are shocked if one spits upon
the earth, because they interpret this as an insult to
the devil.” He traces this abhorrence to “Zoroastrian
prescription, forbidding the earth in any way to be
defiled.” “The Daevayasna or devil-worshippers in
Avesta,” he goes on to say, “may indirectly have had
a kindred notion, <i>i. e.</i>, not mentioning the name of
Satan.” Moreover this American critic is informed
that the Yezidis “believe in a father primeval, that
lived before Adam, and did not fall into sin.” And
this information leads him to think that such a notion
helps “the Zoroastrian student to recognize at once a
far-off reminiscence of Avestan Gaya-Mashai, the
Iranian Adam and Eve.”<a id="FNanchor_101_101" href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p>

<p>One noticeable thing in favor of the two schools is
that their method is strictly scientific, in the modern
sense of the term. It is a posteriori and not a priori;
it is inductive. Yet however scientific their method
may seem to be their conclusions cannot be accepted
as final. For the inductive method, according to the
great French scientist, Poincaré, cannot give us exact
knowledge because its experiments do not cover all
the instances in a given case. There can be only a
partial verification. There will always remain some
phenomena that cannot be brought within the sphere
of a particular observation.<a id="FNanchor_102_102" href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> Now, this is exactly
the case in the subject under consideration. Only in
some phases does the Yezidi religion resemble that of
the old Persians. There are other beliefs which do
not come under this category, and which seem to bear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
the traces of some other religions. What are we to
do with these?<a id="FNanchor_103_103" href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> The advocates of the theory in
question admit that such is the case, but they assert
that “the resemblances of the Yezidi religion to Christianity
and Islam are accidental”; that “owing to the
residence of the Yezidis among the Mohammedans,
the sect naturally has much in common with Islam.”<a id="FNanchor_104_104" href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>
But why are the resemblances to Iranism not to be
accounted for in the same way as those to other religions?
Why may not equally strong inference be
made from the likeness to Christianity? And what
is the basis of such a discrimination? On these questions
we are left entirely in the dark. Now, it is this
lack of ground for their method of procedure that
leads one to seek the solution of the problem on some
other verifiable hypothesis.</p>

<p>There is still another school among the western
orientalists. I refer to those who maintain that the
Yezidi sect was founded by Šeiḫ ‘Adi. A modern
writer who holds this theory, after critically reviewing
the views held by the different scholars, proceeds
to advance his own idea. To emphasize it, and leave
no room for further criticism, he claims that the
theory has been “generally” accepted. To quote:</p>

<p>“It is generally agreed upon that the sect of the
Yezidis was founded by Šeiḫ ‘Adi. He is a historical
personage, but it is exceedingly difficult, and almost
impossible, to establish any historical facts out of the
mist of very fantastic stories current about him.”<a id="FNanchor_105_105" href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<p>He supports his notion by an appeal to an Arab<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
author, Kasi Ahmad ibn-Ḫallikan, from whom,
according to this writer, an extract relating to Šeiḫ
‘Adi was published by one who for years was a resident
of the city of Mosul.<a id="FNanchor_106_106" href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> This statement that Ibn
Ḫallikan gives the biography of ‘Adi is a fact that
cannot be questioned; but that ‘Adi founded the
Yezidi sect is a theory that is by no means “generally
agreed upon.” Nor can it be substantiated. To
justify this position, let me quote in full what the Arab
biographer and two other Mohammedan scholars have
to say on the problem.</p>

<p>1 What Ibn Ḫallikan has to say on Šeiḫ ‘Adi:</p>

<p>“The Šeiḫ ‘Adi Ibn Masafir Al-Hakkari was an
ascetic, celebrated for the holiness of his life, and the
founder of a religious order called after him Al-‘Adawiah.
His reputation spread to distant countries,
and the number of his followers increased to a great
multitude. Their belief in his sanctity was so excessive
that, in saying their prayers, they took him for
their ḳibla; and imagined that in the next life they
would have in him their most precious treasure and
their best support. Before this, he had as a disciple a
great number of eminent šeiḫs and men remarkable
for their holiness. He then retired from the world
and fixed his residence among the mountains of the
Hakkari, near Mosul, where he built a cell (or a
monastery) and gained the favor of the people in that
country to a degree unexampled in the history of the
anchorites. It is said that the place of his birth was
a village called Bait Far, situated in the province of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
Baalbek, and that the house in which he was born is
still visited (as a place of sanctity). He died <span class="smcap lowercase">A. H.</span>
557 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 1162), or as some say <span class="smcap lowercase">A. H.</span> 555, in the town
where he resided (in the Hakkari region). He was
interred in the monastery that he had erected. His
tomb is much frequented, being considered by his
followers one of the most sacred spots to which a
pilgrimage can be made. His descendants continue to
wear the same distinctive attire as he did and to walk
in his footsteps. The confidence placed in their
merits is equal to that formerly shown to their ancestor,
and like him they are treated with profound
respect. Abu Ibarakat ibn Al-Mustawfi notices the
Šeiḫ ‘Adi in his history of Arbela, and places him in
the list of those persons who visited that city.
Muzaffar Ad-Din, the sovereign of Arbela, said that
when a boy he saw the Šeiḫ ‘Adi at Mosul. According
to him, he was a man of medium size and tawny complexion;
he related also many circumstances indicative
of his great sanctity. The šeiḫ died at the age of
ninety years.”<a id="FNanchor_107_107" href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p>2 What Mohammed-Amin-Al-‘Omari has to say
on Šeiḫ ‘Adi:</p>

<p>“They say that the šeiḫ ‘Adi was one of the
inhabitants of Ba‘albek; that he transported himself
to Mosul, and from thence to Jabal Laš, a dependency
of this city (Mosul), where he resided until his death.
They also say that he was from Ḥawran, and that his
lineage goes back as far as Marwan bn al-Ḥakam, also
that he is Šaraf ad Din Abou´l Faḍail ‘Adi bn Masafir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
bn Isma‘il bn Mousa bn Marwan bn al Ḥasan bn
Marwan bn Mohammed bn Marwan bn al Ḥakam,
who died in the year 558. His grave, which is well
known, is the object of pious pilgrimages.”</p>

<p>“God tried him by a calamity, to wit, the appearance
of a sect of apostates, called the Yezidis, because
they claim to be descended from Yezid. They adore
the sun and render worship to the devil. The following
are some of the precepts of their faith that I found
in a small tract made by one of the inhabitants of
Aleppo, who knows their religion:</p>

<p>I. Adultery becomes lawful when committed by
(mutual) consent.</p>

<p>II. They pretend that when the day of judgment
comes, the šeiḫ ‘Adi will put them into a wooden
basin which he will place on his head in order to cause
them to enter into Paradise while uttering these contemptuous
words: ‘I do this (or, I make them do
this) by compelling God or in spite of him.’</p>

<p>III. The visit which they pay to the tomb of Šeiḫ
‘Adi is for them a pilgrimage which the devotees
accomplished no matter how far distant the country is
that they inhabit, and without being concerned about
the expenses that the journey carries with it.”<a id="FNanchor_108_108" href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p>3 What Yasin Al-Hatib-al-Omari-Al-Mausili has
to say on Šeiḫ ‘Adi:</p>

<p>“In this year 557 died the saint and the pious
devotee ‘Adi bn Musafir, who performed miracles.
His death took place in the city Hakkariya, one of the
dependencies of Mosul. His origin is from Ba‘albek,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
which he left in order to come to Mosul, that he might
consecrate himself to God. He passed a solitary life
on the mountains and in caverns where lions and
other wild beasts visited him often.”</p>

<p>“It is said that he was descended from the family
of Omayyids, and this is the lineage which he
attributed to himself: ‘Adi bn Musafir bn Isma‘il bn
Mousa bn Marwan bn al-Ḥasan bn Marwan bn al-Ḥakam
bn Al-‘Ass bn Omayya.”</p>

<p>“He was versed in the knowledge of the divine law.
God tried him by a calamity by raising the Yezidis,
who pretended that this šeiḫ is God, and who have
made his tomb the object of their pilgrimage. They
arrive there every year at the sound of drums in order
to give themselves to games and debauchery.”</p>

<p>“The Christians of the land, and especially the
partisans of the Nestorians are far from having the
same opinion of the Šeiḫ ‘Adi as have the Moslems
or the Yezidis. The following passage which one reads
in a Chaldean manuscript entitled ‘Awarda’<a id="FNanchor_109_109" href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> and which
I saw some time ago in the Church of Karmalis,<a id="FNanchor_110_110" href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a>
proves this sufficiently. This is the translation of the
passage which I have extracted from a song composed
by a bishop of Arbil, in honor of Rabban Hormuzd<a id="FNanchor_111_111" href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a>
and other saints, and in which the author makes mention
of ‘Adi in these terms:</p>

<p>“‘Great misfortunes have followed, falling upon
us; a formidable enemy came to torment us. He was
a descendant of Hagar, the slave of our mother. This
enemy who made our life unfortunate was a Moham<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>medan,
called ‘Adi. He deceived us by vile tricks,
and has finished by taking possession of our riches
and of our convent, which he consecrated to things
that are illicit (to have a strange worship). An
innumerable multitude of Mussulmen have attached
themselves to him and have vowed to him a blind
submission. The renown of his name, which is Šeiḫ
‘Adi, has spread down to our days in all the cities of
all the countries.’”<a id="FNanchor_112_112" href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p>These are the accounts which we have of Šeiḫ ‘Adi
in his relation to the Yezidis, and they deserve our
special attention. For not only are the writers scholars
of the highest authority, but they are to a certain
extent eye-witness authorities. The last two are from
the city of Mosul, which is the only city in the Mohammedan
world whose widely spreading scholarship
has acquired for it the name “Dar-al-‘Ulum,” <i>i. e.</i>,
the home of sciences. Moreover, they come from a
family whose members are known as ‘Olama, highly
intellectual, broad-minded Mohammedan gentlemen.
While at Mosul, I had the honor of calling often on
Ḥasan Efendi al ‘Omari, and especially on Suleiman
Efendi al ‘Omari. Ibn Ḫallikan as a trustworthy
biographer needs no further introduction than the
mere mentioning of his name. What adds to his reputation
as a scholar is the fact that, being a resident of
Arbila in the province of Mosul, he had at his command
firsthand information.</p>

<p>Another noteworthy fact is that all three of these
scholars agree in their account of Šeiḫ ‘Adi, in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
tracing of his genealogy, in describing him as the most
perfect model of hermits, in praising him for his
manner of life, which they regard as a life of holiness.
They agree also in their definition of the common
people’s attitude toward the Šeiḫ: that he was deified
and that his tomb has been made the object of pilgrimage.
And finally they are silent about his supposed
founding of the sect in question. There is no
intimation that he was a heretic, or that he established
such a schism. To be sure, Ibn Ḫallikan makes mention
of a religious order which was called after the
Šeiḫ’s name, but he designates them as ‘Adawia and
not as Yezidis. This might have been such an order
as the Brotherhood of Assanusi, called after
Mohammed ibn ‘Ali as-Sanusi, or as many other
orders of dervishes and šeiḫs of mystical type, that
have taken rise from time to time in the religious
history of Islam. The other two speak of the appearance
of the Yezidis, but they look at the incident as
a calamity to the šeiḫ because they deified him and
worshipped at his tomb. Their remarks tend to show
that the Yezidi sect were known as such before the
time of ‘Adi; that their appellation was based on the
pretension that they were descendants of Yesid; that
they were apostates from Islam; that they were some
of those who were attached to ‘Adi by reason of his
wide reputation as a saint, and were led by their
ignorance to take him for a god; and that they were
worshippers of the sun and the devil. It is inconceivable
to us, if we apply the principles of modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
criticism to what we know of the character of the
Mohammedan historians, that they should write the
life of one who is responsible for the rise of a sect,
the foundation of whose religion is the devil, and not
curse him and the devil with him a hundred million
times.</p>

<p>Such are the theories that have been advanced in
the discussion relating to the religious origin of the
Yezidi sect, and we have found not only that they are
far from reaching the solution of the problem, but
also that the method that they employ does not seem
to be the proper one for solving such a question. The
tradition of the Yezidis that they are descended from
Yezid bn Mu‘Awiya which has been accepted as the
fact by some western scholars is only a myth, without
historical justification. As to the Christian tradition,
all that can tell us is that some Yezidis might have
been at one time Christians; but as to who was the
founder of the sect it gives us no light. Likewise, all
that we can learn from the theory advocated by the
second school is that some phases of the Persian religion
might have survived with that of the devil-worshippers.
We may admit, I think, that some
Yezidis are Persian in their origin. But as to who
was the originator of their religion this theory helps
us not a whit. So also we have found that the relation
of Šeiḫ ‘Adi to this sect is not that of a founder. He
is only one of many whom their ignorance led to class
as deities.</p>

<h4>IV<br />

<small><span class="smcap">The Dogmatic View of Mohammedan Scholars</span></small></h4>


<p>While the Yezidi myth regards the sect as descendants
of Adam, of Yezid bn Mu awiya, or of a colony
from the north, while the Christian tradition of the
East traces them to a Christian origin, while among
the western orientalists some say that they were
founded by Yezid bn Mu awiya, others that they
are of Persian origin, etc., the Mohammedan dogmatics,
on the other hand, assert that they are
<i>Murtaddoon</i>, that is, apostates from Islam. To understand
the significance of this term, I must mention
the several words used for those who are considered
as infidels according to Mohammedan theology.
<i>Kafir</i> is one who hides or denies the truth; <i>Mushrik</i>
is one who ascribes companions to God; <i>Mulhid</i> is
one who has deviated from the truth; <i>Zandik</i> is one
who asserts his belief in the doctrine of dualism;
<i>Munafik</i> is one who secretly disbelieves in the mission
of Mohammed; <i>Dahri</i> is an atheist; <i>Watani</i> is a
pagan or idolator; and finally <i>Murtadd</i> is one who
apostasizes from Islam. The Yezidis are put in the
category of those who, after once accepting the religion
of Islam, later rejected it.</p>

<p>One author, of those to whose writings I had access,
in an explicit statement regards these people as
apostates. I refer to Amin-al-‘Omari-al Mausili (of
Mosul). After praising Šeiḫ ‘Adi, the Mosulian goes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
on to say, “God tried him (<i>i. e.</i>, ‘Adi) by a calamity,
to wit, the appearance of Al-Murtaddoon, called the
Yezidis because they pretended to have been descended
from Yezid.<a id="FNanchor_113_113" href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> Another Mohammedan
scholar that mentions these people is Yasin Al-Ḫatib-al-‘Omari-al
Mausili. Writing on Šeiḫ ‘Adi, and
praising him as the former writer does, he says, “He
was versed in the knowledge of the divine law. God
tried him by a calamity by raising up the Yezidis, who
pretend that this Šeiḫ is God, and who have made
his tomb the object of their pilgrimage.<a id="FNanchor_114_114" href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p>While these authors throw some light on the subject
that the sect in question derives its appellation from
a historic person, they leave us entirely in the dark
as to who that person was, as the Arab historians
mention many prominent men who bore the name
Yezid.</p>

<p>This obscurity regarding the person of the founder
of the sect is made clear by one whose work is
equally, if not more, authoritative than that of any
other Mohammedan scholar on matters pertaining to
religious and philosophical sects. This authority is
Mohammed Aš-Šahrastani. He is the only Mohammedan
writer that I could reach that, in a clear
language, traces this most interesting sect to its
founder.</p>

<p>“The Yezidis are the followers of Yezid bn Unaisa,
who [said that he] kept friendship with the first
Muhakkama before the Azariḳa, and he separated
himself from those who followed after them with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
exception of Al-Abaḍia, for with these he kept friendship.
He believed that God would send an apostle
from among the Persians and would reveal to him a
book that is already written in heaven, and would
reveal the whole (book) to him at one time,<a id="FNanchor_115_115" href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> and as
a result he would leave the law of Mohammed, the
Chosen One, may God bless and save him!—and
follow the religion of the Sabians mentioned in the
Koran. But these are not the Sabians who are found
in Ḥaran and Wasit. But Yezid kept friendship with
the people of the book who recognized the Chosen
One as a prophet, even though they did not accept
his (Mohammed’s) religion. And he said that the
followers of the ordinances are among those who
agree with him; but that others are hiding the truth
and give companions to God and that every sin, small
or great, is idolatry.”<a id="FNanchor_116_116" href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></p>

<p>It is clear, then, that Aš-Šahrastani finds the religious
origin of this interesting people in the person of
Yezid bn Unaisa. He calls them his <i>Aseḥab</i>, <i>i. e.</i>, his
followers, a term by which he designates the relation
between a sect and its originator. Al-Ḥaraṯiyah
he describes as “Aseḥab al-Ḥareṯ,” and “Al Ḥafeziyah
Aseḥab Hafez,” and so on. We are to understand,
therefore, that to the knowledge of the writer, bn
Unaisa is the founder of the Yezidi sect, which took
its name from him.</p>

<p>Mohammed Aš-Šahrastani states also, in a logical
way, the theological views of the head of the Yezidis.
Yezid, he says, is on the positive side, in sympathy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
with the first Muḥakkamah before the Azariḳa. Now,
the first Muhakkamah is an appellative applied to the
Muslim schismatics called Al-Ḫawarij, because they
disallowed the judgment of the Hakaman, <i>i. e.</i>, the
two judges, namely ‘Abd Mousa al-Aš-‘Aree and Am
ibn-al-‘As; and said that judgment belongs only to
God. And Al-Azariḳa were a heretical Muslim sect
called Al-Ḫawarij or Ḥeroriyah, so named in relation
to Nafi‘ ibn-Al-Azraḳ. They asserted that ‘Ali
committed an act of infidelity by submitting his case
to arbitration, and that the slaying of him by Ibn
Muljama was just; and they declare that the companions
(of the Prophet) were guilty of infidelity.
Yezid moreover, is said to have been in sympathy with
Al-Abaḍiyah, a sect founded by ‘Abd-Allah ibn Ibad,
who taught that if a man commits a kabirah or great
sin he is an infidel and not a believer.</p>

<p>It is evident, therefore, that according to this exposition
the Yezid in question was one of Al-Ḫawarij,
and their principle is expressly attributed to him:
every sin, small or great, is idolatry. According to
this it might be inferred that the Yezidis were originally
a Ḫarijite sub-sect. They still hold to the
Ḫarijite principle. (Cf. their position to the Ottoman
Government, pp. 71-74). As we said some
Mohammedan writers other than Ashahr-Astani also
(pp. 118-119) regard them as apostate Moslems, Aš-Šahrastani
himself classes them with the Moslem
heretics. Now Al-Ḫawarij were the first to rebel
against ‘Ali at Ḥaroora, a certain suburb of Al-Koofa,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
from which it is distant two miles. They are called
also Al-Ḥeroriyah, because they first assembled there
and accepted the doctrine that government belongs
only to God. And one sect of Al-Ḫawarij was An-Nâṣibiyah
who made it a matter of religious obligation
to bear a violent hatred to ‘Ali. Such is the place
of bn Unaisa among the Moslem heretics, but this is
only one side of his religious system.<a id="FNanchor_117_117" href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></p>

<p>There is another side to Yezid’s doctrine. He held
that God would send an apostle from Persia, to whom
he would reveal a book already written in heaven.
This apostle was to be an opponent of the prophet
of Islam in that he would leave Mohammed’s religion
and follow that of the Ṣabians mentioned in the
Koran. These are referred to by Mohammed, together
with the Christians and the Jews, in three different
places in the Book. One such reference is in Surah
2, 59: “They who believe as well as Jews, Christians
and Sabeans, whoever believeth in God and in the
Last Day, and do that which is right, shall have their
reward with their Lord.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Surah 5, 73, also:</p>

<p>“They who believe as well as Jews, Christians and
Sabeans, whoever of them believe in God and the Last
Day, and do what is right, on them shall no fear come;
neither shall they be put to grief.”</p>

<p>And Surah 22, 17:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>
<p>“They who believe as well as Jews, Sabeans and
Christians and the Magians, and those who join gods
with God, verily God shall decide between them on
the Day of Resurrection.”</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In these passages Mohammed seems to regard the
Sabians of the Koran as believers in the true God and
in the resurrection. And in Surah 22, 17, he seems
to distinguish them from Magians and polytheists.
Hence, we are to infer that the Apostle of whom
Yezid bn Unaisa says that he will come from the land
of the ´Ajam (Persian), will identify himself with
the religion of the Ṣabians. This implies that he will
believe in the true God and in the Day of Resurrection.
But from some Arab writers we learn more of
these Ṣabian beliefs than the Prophet of Islam has
mentioned. According to some the Ṣabians were a
sect of unbelievers who worshipped the stars secretly,
and openly professed to be Christians. According to
others, they were of the religion of Ṣabi, the son of
Seth, the son of Adam; while others said they
resembled the Christians, except that their <i>ḳiblah</i> was
toward the South, from whence the wind blows. In
the <i>Kamûs</i> it is said that they were of the religion of
Noah. Al-Baiḍawi says that some assert that they
were worshippers of angels, and that others say that
they are the worshippers of stars. Al-Bertuni[48] calls
the Manichaeans of Samarḳand Sabians. Bar
Hebraeus<a id="FNanchor_118_118" href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> asserts that the religion of the Sabians is
the same as that of the ancient Chaldeans. In commenting
on Surah 2, 59, Zamaḫšari (Al-Keššaf) says
that the name Ṣabian comes from a root meaning one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
who has departed from one religion to another religion,
and that the Ṣabians were those who departed
from Judaism and Christianity and worshipped
angels. On this same verse, Šams Ad-Din Mohammed
Al-Ḥarrani (Jami Al-Bijan fi Tafsir Al-Koran) says:
“The Ṣabians, <i>i. e.</i>, those who departed from one religion
to another religion, stood between the Magians
and the Jews and the Christians without having any
revealed religion of their own. According to some
they were people of the Book; according to others
they were worshippers of angels; while others
say, they believed in one God but followed no
Prophet.” This same commentator on Surah 5, 73,
says: “The Ṣabians were a Christian sect; some say
that they were worshippers of angels; others assert
that they worshipped God alone, but had no revealed
religion.” On this same verse Zamaḫšari remarks,
“The Ṣabians were those who departed from all religions.”</p>

<p>Now what Mohammed Aš-Šahrastani really means
by the Ṣabians of the Koran, I am unable to state. In
his general discussion of Ṣabianism however (vol. 2,
pp. 201-250), he seems to speak of two main Ṣabian
sects. He refers to one together with the ancient
philosophers; and declares that the Ṣabians followed
rational ordinances and judgments which originally
they may have derived from some prophetic authority,
but that they denied all prophecy. The philosophers
followed their own devices and took their system
from no prophetic source. The authority we are quot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>ing
calls this sect “the original Ṣabian sect,” and says
that it followed Seth and Enoch. In another place
(vol. 1, p. 24) he writes, “The Jews and the Christians
follow a revealed Book; the Magians and the
Manichæans, a like Book; the original Ṣabian sect,
ordinances and judgments, but accepts no Book; the
original philosophers, the atheists, the star-worshippers,
the idol-worshippers, and the Brahmans believe
in none of these.”</p>

<p>The other main Ṣabian sect is mentioned together
with the Jews, the Christians, and the Moslems. The
difference between these religious bodies, according to
Aš-Šahrastani, is that “the Ṣabians do not follow the
Law (of God) or Islam; the Christians and the Jews
believe in these, but do not accept the Law (religion)
of Mohammed; while the Moslems believe in them all.</p>

<p>Aš-Šahrastani, moreover, derives the name Ṣabian
(p. 203) from a root meaning one who turns aside,
deviates; and declares that the Ṣabians were those
who turned aside from the statutes of God, and
deviated from the path of the prophets. He seems
to regard the notion that man is incapable of approaching
God, and that therefore he is in constant need of
intercessors and mediators, as a controlling idea in
Ṣabianism. This belief, the writer points out, has
manifested itself in three different forms: in the
veneration of angels among what he calls the followers
of angels; the adoration of stars among the followers
of stars; and in the worship of idols among
the followers of idols, heathens (pp. 203, 244). The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
last two, we are told, are polytheists, and referred to
in the Koranic statement:</p>

<p>(“When Abraham said to his father, Azar, ‘Dost
thou take idols for gods?’—Surah 6, 74. Said he—Abraham—‘Do
ye serve what ye hew out?’—Surah
37, 93. When he—Abraham—said to his father, ‘Oh
my sir! why dost thou worship what can neither hear
nor see nor avail thee aught?’—Surah 19, 43.”)</p>

<p>And in the following references:</p>

<p>(“And when the night overshadowed him he saw a
star and said, ‘This is my Lord.’ And when he saw
the moon beginning to rise he said, ‘This is my Lord.’
And when he saw the sun beginning to rise he said,
‘This is my Lord, this is greatest of all.’”)—Surah 6,
76, 77, 78.</p>

<p>But Mohammed Aš-Šahrastani makes mention of
another Ṣabian sect which he names Al-Ḫarbâniyah
(pp. 248-250). Its distinctive feature, he says, is the
belief that the Creator indwelleth in other beings.
They held that God is one in his essence, but many
in his appearances. He dwells in the seven planets,
and in the earthly beings that are rational, good, and
excellent in righteousness. Human body is his temple;
he may abide within it and live and move as a man.
He is too good, we read, to create anything evil. God
is the source of good, and evil is either an accidental
and necessary thing, or related to the evil source.
They believed also, our authority informs us, in the
transmigration of souls, and taught that the Resurrection
of which the prophets had spoken was only the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
end of one generation and the beginning of another
here on earth. This doctrine, the Mohammedan
critics affirm, is alluded to in the passages:</p>

<p>(“Does he promise you that when ye are dead, and
have become dust and bones, that then ye will be
brought forth? Away, away with what ye are promised,—there
is only our life in the world! We die and
we live and we shall not be raised.”)—Surah 23,
37-39.</p>

<p>Now I cannot say which of the Ṣabian sects are
those that “are mentioned in the Koran,” which
Yezid bn Unaisa says, the Persian Apostle will follow;
nor can I say which are those that “are found in
Ḥarran and Wasit.” One thing, however, is clear:
according to Aš-Šahrastani the Ṣabians of the Koran
differ in their faith from those of Ḥarran. The
Ḥarranians were remnants of the old heathen of
Mesopotamia; they were polytheistic, and star-worship
had the chief place in their religion, as in the
worship of the older Babylonian and Syrian faiths.
They were regarded as such by the Mohammedans, so
that under Al-Mamûn, they sheltered themselves
under the name, Ṣabians, that they might be entitled
to the toleration which the Ṣabians of the Koran have
because they were considered among the people of
the Book.<a id="FNanchor_119_119" href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> Another thing to be noticed is that there
is a close resemblance between the belief of the
Ṣabian sect which Aš-Šahrastani calls Al-Ḫarbâniyah
and that of the Yezidi sect.</p>

<p>Such is, in the main, the religion of the Persian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
Apostle and is logically the religion of Yezid bn
Unaisa which announces the coming of such a messenger.
We may conclude, therefore, that the founder
of the Yezidi sect believed in God and in the Day of
Resurrection; that he, perhaps, honored the angels
and the stars, and that he was neither polytheistic nor
a true believer in the Prophet of Islam. This last
point is referred to also explicitly in the statement
quoted, that Yezid associated himself with those of
the people of the Book who recognized Mohammed
as a prophet though they did not become his followers.
This is the negative aspect, so to speak, of bn Unaisa’s
religious views. He is also said to have claimed that
the followers of the ordinances<a id="FNanchor_120_120" href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> agreed with him.
This statement tends to indicate that he might have
accepted some phases of the Muslim faith. And the
fact that he belonged to <i>Al-Ḫawarij</i> implies that he
was one of those who were “condemning and rejecting
‘Ali for his scandalous crime of parleying with Mu‘awiya,
the first of the Omayyid line, and submitting
his claims to arbitration.” Such are in brief the
fundamental elements in the religious system of one
who may be held responsible for the rise of the sect
in question.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt, it seems to me, that the
Yezidis are the followers of Yezid bn Unaisa. The
statement of our authority, Mohammed Aš-Šahrastani
(see pp. <a href='#Page_119'>119-120</a>), is so clear that it can bear no other
interpretation. And what is far more important, it
comes from the pen of one who is considered of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
highest authority among the Arab scholars on questions
relating to philosophical and religious sects. In
his bibliographical work Ibn Ḫallikan speaks of his
profound scholarship in the highest terms: “Aš-Šahrastani,
a dogmatic theologian of the ‘Ašarite sect,
was distinguished as an Imam and a doctor of the
law. He displayed the highest abilities as a jurisconsult.
The Kitab al-Milal wa n-Niḥal (treatise on
religions and sects) is one of his works on scholastic
theology. He remained without an equal in that
branch of science.” Now, Mohammed Aš-Šahrastani
(<span class="smcap lowercase">A. H.</span> 467-549) <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 1074-1133 was a contemporary
of ‘Adi (<span class="smcap lowercase">A. H.</span> 465-555) <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 1072-1162, yet he makes
no allusion to him when he refers to the rise of this
most interesting sect; nor does he make mention of
any other supposed founder except the one he records.
For these reasons I accept the historical assertion of
this distinguished author.</p>

<p>I am of the opinion, therefore, that the Yezidis
received their name from Yezid bn Unaisa, their
founder as a kharijite sub sect in the early period of
Islam; that, attracted by Šeiḫ ‘Adi’s reputation, they
joined his movement and took him for their chief
religious teacher; that in the early history of the sect
and of ‘Adi many Christians, Persians, and Moslems
united with it; and that large survivals or absorptions
of pagan beliefs or customs are to be found in modern
Yezidism. In other words the actual religion of the
Yezidis is syncretism in which it is easy to recognize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
Yezidi, Christian, Moslem, especially sufism and
pagan elements.</p>

<p>Like the master they believe in the true God and
in the Resurrection, honor the angels and the stars,
disbelieve in the mission of Mohammed and ignore
‘Ali, regard every sin, small or great, as idolatry or
infidelity, and expect the appearance of a prophet
from Persia. The fact of their connection with such
a religious leader explains the reason why they are
hated by both the Sunnites and the Shiites. The followers
of bn My‘awiya can only be despised by the
latter; but the believer such a heretical one as the
son of Unaisa are necessarily condemned by the
former also. For he was, as I have already stated,
anti-Mohammed and anti-‘Ali. And it is worth
remembering also that the fourth Calif is more honored
among the Moslems of Persia than his son
Ḥusein is; and consequently any contemptuous attitude
toward the father will give rise to more bitter
feeling on the part of his followers than the murder
of the son would occasion.</p>

<p>There is one question, however, which does not
appear to be very easy to answer; namely, how the
Yezidis came to trace their origin to Yezid bn Mu‘awiya
and not to Yezid bn Unaisa. Three explanations
may be given. One is that their ignorance led
them to mistake the former for the latter, as they
have identified many of their šeiḫs with angels and
deities. Among ignorant people, as these are, without
record and without any one who can read, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
occasion of such an error is not strange. Another
answer is that they intentionally made the identification
in order to escape the persecution of the Sunnites,
among whom most of them lived. Though
specious, this idea is not tenable, for it is not their
habit to deny their origin for the sake of safety.
Even in that case, they would still be hated by the
Shiites. The third theory is that they have a notion
that they are descended from a noble personage, and
the second Calif being such a personage, their ignorance
led them to take him for their founder. And
the identity of the two names, of course, helped much
toward the formation of the legend.</p>

<p>It is to be noticed that the religion of this Yezid
contained, from its inception, a fundamental doctrine
which appealed to the pagans of Persia more than it
did to Al-jahaleen of Arabia. In its very structure
it insulted the latter country by despising its prophet.
On the other hand, it expressed its sympathy with a
prophet from Persia and with his religion. This
declaration magnified Persia and its inhabitants and
gave them preëminence, thereby making an impression
on the attitude of the people toward Yezidism.
Therefore they looked on it not as a foreign but as a
native cult. The entertaining of such a view, consequently,
led many fire, or devil-worshippers and
the followers of Zoroastrianism to embrace the new
religion (Al-mašrik, vol. 2, p. 35). And if the predicted
teacher arose, we can imagine the great success
which he must have had among his countrymen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
This fact not only accounts for the existence of traces
of old Persian religion, but it gives the reason why
the Kurdish predominates over the Arab element in
Yezidism.</p>

<p>The new sect appears to have existed as a very
loose organization after the death of its founder: this
looseness put them in a condition to follow any one
who would exhibit some qualifications for leadership.
Therefore, when they heard about ‘Adi they naturally
flocked to him. And it is very likely that, entertaining
the idea of a coming prophet as they still do, they
might have thought him the promised one. What
might have added to the confirmation of this notion
was his fame as a saint, to whom a number of
miracles were attributed. Even the lions and the
serpents which lived in his neighborhood and paid
him frequent visits were endowed, it is said, with
supernatural sweetness.</p>

<p>From what we know of ‘Adi’s movement, we have
sufficient reason to conclude that many Moslems and
Christians followed him. The historians of both
faiths bear witness to the fact that ‘Adi’s reputation
was widespread, and that people of every condition
followed him (see pp. <a href='#Page_111'>111-115</a>). The Nestorian bishop
of Arbela, whom Yasin Al-‘Omari quotes (see p. <a href='#Page_114'>114</a>),
asserts that innumerable multitudes flocked to him,
deplores the situation of the Christian church resulting
from this uprising, and complains of the possession
by the Šeiḫ of a monastery belonging to his
denomination. Moreover, as has been shown, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
exist among the Yezidis certain Moslem and Christian
practices which cannot be accounted for on any other
ground, since, so far as we know their character, they
make no compromise in matters of religion.</p>

<p>Not only Yezidi, Persian, Moslem, and Christian
elements are to be found in modern Yezidism, but
there are many remains of the old pagan religions
which find expression in the devil-worshippers of
to-day. Such is the notion of the sacredness of the
number seven, an idea which belongs to the common
stock of the ancient inhabitants of Mesopotamia.
The Yezidis have seven sanjaks, each has seven
burners; their cosmogony shows that God created
seven angels or gods; their principal prayer is the
appeal to God through seven šeiḫs; the sceptre engraved
on the front of the temple of their great saint
has seven branches. This reminds us at once of the
Ṣabians who adored seven gods or angels who directed
the course of seven planets; the seven days of the
week were dedicated to their respective deities.
Moreover, we note in the Babylonian-Assyrian poem,
the seven gates through which Ištar descended to the
land without return. Likewise, the number seven
played an important part in the religious system of
Israel.</p>

<p>Further, like the Ḥarranians, the modern <i>Šatan-parast</i>
worship the sun and the moon at their rising
and setting. The sun was worshipped also in Canaan,
I Sam. 6: 9. The horses of the sun were worshipped
in the temple at Jerusalem, II Kings 25: 5, 11. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
worship of the host of heaven (the sun, the moon, the
planets), were found in Judea. In Babylon, there
were at least two shrines to sun-god Šamas, one at
Sippar, and the other at Larsa.</p>

<p>Other survivals of the ancient religions found in
Yezidism are the worship of birds (see p. <a href='#Page_150'>150</a>); the
special importance attached to the New Year because
of its bearing on individual welfare by reason of the
good or evil decision of the gods rendered them (see
pp. 46, 174); and the belief in occurrences of nuptials
in the heavens (see p. <a href='#Page_174'>174</a>).</p>

<p>Moreover, many religious beliefs of the Pre-Islamic
Arabs survive among the modern Yezidis. Such is
the belief in sacred wells in connection with sanctuaries
found in all parts of the Semitic region, the most
conspicuous of which is that of Mecca. Gifts were
cast into this holy water of Zamzam, as they were
cast into the sacred wells of other places. When the
grandfather of Mohammed ‘Abd Al-Muttalib cleaned
out the well, he found two golden gazelles and a
number of swords. The water of such holy springs
was believed to possess healing power, and was carried
home by pilgrims, as the water of Zamzam now is
(Yaḳut I, 434).<a id="FNanchor_121_121" href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> An impure person, furthermore,
dared not approach the sacred waters. A woman in
her uncleanness was afraid for her children’s sake to
bathe in the holy water at the sanctuary of Dusares.
According to Ibn Hišam “A woman who adopts
Islam breaks with the heathen god by purifying herself
in this pool.” This was taken to mean that her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
act was a breach of the ritual of the spot. And all
the pilgrims changed their clothes when they entered
the sacred precinct.<a id="FNanchor_122_122" href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></p>

<p>Another common heathen practice in the time of
Al-jahliya was the worship of holy trees. According
to Tabari there was a date-palm tree at Nejran. It
was adored at an annual feast, when it was hung all
around with fine clothes and women’s ornaments. A
similar tree to which the people of Mecca resorted
annually, and hung upon it weapons, garments,
ostriches’ eggs, and other things, is spoken of in the
tradition of the prophet under the name of “dhat
anwat,” or “tree to hang things on.”<a id="FNanchor_123_123" href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> The Goddess
Al-‘Ozza was believed to reside in a tree. According
to Yaḳut (III, 261), the tree at Hadaibiya, mentioned
in the Koran (sura XLVIII, 18) was visited
by pilgrims who expected to derive a blessing from it,
till it was cut down by the Calif Omar lest it should be
worshipped like Al-Lat and Al-‘Ozza. It was considered
deadly to pluck a twig from such sacred
trees.</p>

<p>The prevalence of stone-worship is another sign of
paganism existing before Islam, and noteworthy is the
theory advanced by the Mohammedan writers to
account for its origin. According to Ibn Hišam<a id="FNanchor_124_124" href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> the
beginning of this idolatry was that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span> “the Meccans
when their land became too narrow for them spread
abroad over the country, and all took stones from their
sanctuary, the Kaaba, out of reverence for their
temple, and they set them up whenever they formed
a settlement; and they walked around them as they
used to go about the Holy House. This led them at
last to worship every stone that pleased their fancy.”</p>

<p>It is to be noticed, furthermore, that poly-demonism,
<i>i. e.</i>, the belief in divine powers, in spirits, is the most
characteristic feature of the old nomad religions.
Many traces of this belief have been preserved in the
Old Testament, and also in the popular religion of
the Syria and Palestine of to-day. There are many
instances in the Old Testament of the belief in divine
powers inhabiting springs, trees, stones. We may
refer to the sacred wells at ḳadeš (Gen. 14: 7) and
at Beeršeba (Gen. 21, 28, 30, 31); to the sacred
oracular tree at Shekem (Gen. 12, 6; Deut. 11, 3);
to the sacred stone of Bethel, which gave the place
its name, as it is called “a house of God” (Gen. 28,
22).<a id="FNanchor_125_125" href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>Now, the traces of all these religious beliefs are
found in modern Yezidism. In connection with the
temple of Šeiḫ ‘Adi, there is a sacred spring, and
there are similar ones in different parts of the Yezidi
districts. The water of these springs is held to have
healing power, and is carried by pilgrims to their
homes. In these pools, especially in that of ‘Adi’s,
the Yezidis cast coins, jewelry, and other presents,
which, they think, the chief saint takes from time to
time; and to this day no one may enter the holy
valley with its sacred fountain, unless he first purify
his body and clothes.<a id="FNanchor_126_126" href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> The devil-worshippers adore,
likewise, sacred trees. They make pilgrimages to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
them, hang things on them, and entertain the belief
that whoever unties or shakes off a shred of cloth
will be afflicted with disease. Again, the Yezidis kiss
the stones that satisfy their imagination, and make
vows to them (see pp. <a href='#Page_41'>41</a>, <a href='#Page_51'>50</a>). Nor is this all. The
shouting of the Yezidi pilgrims, as they reach the
sacred territory, and the noisy ceremony of their ḥajj,
with its dancing<a id="FNanchor_127_127" href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> and its excitement—a rite which
has brought against them all sorts of accusations<a id="FNanchor_128_128" href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a>—are
nothing but the remnants of Pre-Islamic
paganism.<a id="FNanchor_129_129" href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p>Such, then, are the steps which the religion of
Yezid took before it came to shape itself into its
present form. It is made up of five different elements,
pagan, that contributed by the founder,
Persian, Mohammedan, and Christian. Does not
such a state of affairs find a historical parallel in
some other religions? Take, for example, Christianity.
In it we find that the distinctive characteristics
of the founder have been wrapped up in many
foreign elements brought in by those who came from
other religions.</p>

Warda, “the rose,” is the name of a collection of
hymns composed by George Warda (1224 A. D.),
Bishop of Arbila; cf. Bar Hebraeus, Chron. Eccl.,
vol. II, p. 402. Warda is one of the most conspicuous
writers of hymns in the thirteenth century which was
the age of song with the Nestorian church. His
poems have entered so largely into the use of the
Nestorian church that one of their service books is to
this day called the Warda; Badger, <i>The Nestorians</i>,
vol. II, p. 25. Some of his hymns speak of the
calamities of the years 1224-1227. A few specimens
are given by Cardaḥi in <i>Liber Thesauri</i>, p. 51.
Badger has translated one in his <i>Nestorians</i>, vol. II,
pp. 51-57. Warda’s poems have been edited by
Heinrich Hilgenfeld, <i>Ausgewählte Gesänge des
Giworgis Warda von Arbil</i>, Leipzig, 1904, and by
Manna, Mosul, 1901.</p></div>

Ḥarran was a city in the north of Mesopotamia, and
southeast of Edessa, at the junction of the Damascus
road with the highway from Nineveh to Carchamish.
The moon-god had a temple in Ḥarran, which enjoyed
a high reputation as a place of pilgrimage.
The city retained its importance down to the time of
the Arab ascendency, but it is now in ruins. Yaḳut
(vol. II, p. 331) says: “It was the home of Ṣabians;
that is, the Ḥarranians who are mentioned by the
authors of Kutub Al-Milal wa n-Nihal.” As to Wasit
this same Yaḳut (vol. IV, p. 881) mentions about
twenty different places bearing this name. The most
prominent one is that built by Al-Hajjaj in 83 A. H.
It is called Wasit “the intermediate” because it was
situated midway between Kufa and Basrah. Another
place Yaḳut (p. 889) mentions is Wasit ul-Raḳḳat,
a town on the western side of the Euphrates, and about
two days’ journey from Ḥarran. Perhaps this is the
Wasit that Aš-Šahrastanî means.</p></div>

Hudud, pl. of Hadad, restrictive ordinances, or
statutes, of God respecting things lawful and things
unlawful. The Hudud of God are of two kinds:
First, those ordinances respecting eatables, drinkables,
marriage, etc., what are lawful thereof and what are
unlawful. Second, castigations, or punishments, prescribed,
or appointed, to be inflicted upon him who
does that which he has been forbidden to do. The
first kind are called Hudud because they denote limits
which God has forbidden to transgress; the second,
because they prevent one’s committing again those
acts for which they are appointed as punishments, or
because the limits thereof are determined. See Lane’s

the orthodox way is as follows: Arrived within a
short distance of Mecca, the pilgrims put off their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>

Sandals may be worn but not shoes, and the head
must be left uncovered. In Mandeanism, each person

The original idea might have been that the waters,
the stones, and the trees themselves were divinities.
In Jud. 5: 21, we have the statement: “The river
Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river
Kishon.” Now Kais was the name of an Arabian
god in Pre-Islamic time. In Num. 5: 17 seq., an
accused woman is tested by a sacred water. In Deut.
32: 4, “He is the rock,” “rock” is as much a term for
God as El, or elohim; cf. verses 15, 18, 30, 31; II Sam.
23: 3. In Ps. 18: 2, the word rock is used of God,
“the Lord is my rock.” Jacob took the stone which
he had put under his head as a pillow, and raised it up
as a pillar, poured oil upon it and called it the “house
of God,” Gen. 28: 18, 19, 22. “The sound of a going
in the tops of the mulberry trees” (II Sam. 5: 24),
for which David was to wait, was nothing less than
the divine voice speaking to David in accordance with
ancient conceptions.</p></div>

The people in the East are under the impression
that the Yezidis violate the law of morality during
their festivals. According to Hurgronje (vol. 2,
pp. 61-64), immorality is practised also in the sacred
mosque of Mecca. This practice may be a survival of
the institution of Kadeshes, who offered themselves
in honor of the Deity in the sacred places where
license usually prevailed during the festivals (Gen.
38: 21, and Deut. 23: 18).</p></div>

<small><span class="smcap">The Essential Elements in Yezidism</span></small></h3>


<p>Although comparatively few in number, ignorant,
and practically without a literature of any sort, the
followers of Yezid are not without definitely formulated
doctrines of faith which bind them together as a
sect, and distinguish them from every other religious
body. They cherish two fundamental beliefs. They
believe in a deity of the first degree, God; and in a
deity of the second degree, who, they seem to think,
is composed of three persons in one, Melek Ṭâ´ûs,
Šeiḫ ‘Adi and Yezid.<a id="FNanchor_130_130" href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></p>


<h4>I<br />

<span class="smcap">The Yezidi View of God</span></h4>

<p>It is not easy to discover whether the conception of
God, which exists to-day among the Yezidis, however
shadowy, has come from Mohammedan or Christian
sources, or whether it comes from that primitive
stage where the worship of God and of inferior
deities exists side by side. One thing, however, is
apparent, and that is that the Yezidi notion of God
does not seem to be influenced by any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span> “positive religion”
which traces its origin to the teachings of a
great religious founder, who spoke as the organ of a
divine revelation, and deliberately departed from the
traditional religion. The Yezidis’ idea of God is
rather an image left on their mind than the result of
any reflection. Hence, simple as it is, this conception
is not so easy to define. The notion, so prominent in
Greek philosophy, of God as an existence absolute and
complete in himself, unchangeable, outside of time
and space, etc., is unknown in Yezidi theology. So
also the theocratic conception of Jehovah in Judaism
is foreign to the dogma of this sect. Not even the
Mohammedan idea of God as an absolute ruler, and
the distinctive notion which the Christians have of
God as Christ-like in character, are to be found in
the religion of the devil-worshippers. And we have
accustomed ourselves to think of the Supreme Being
in these conventional terms. There is one element,
however, which may be traced to Judaism, Christianity
and Islam, namely, the belief in a personal God.
But Yezidism holds that this deity is only the creator
of the universe and not its sustainer. Its maintenance,
according to this system, is left to the seven gods.
Another element which may be said to be a remnant
of some other religions is the idea of a transcendent
God. But in this point, as in the other, the notion of
transcendentalism in the religion of the devil-worshippers
is not of the same degree as that of the other
religions. The former conceives of the Almighty as
retiring far away, and as having nothing to do with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
the affairs of the world, except once a year, on New
Year’s day, when he sits on his throne, calls the gods
unto him, and delivers the power into the hands of the
god who is to descend to the earth. To sum up,
the Yezidis’ conception of a personal God is transcendental
and static of the extreme type. In this it
resembles somewhat the Platonic idea of the absolute.
They call God in the Kurdish Khuda, and believe that
he manifested himself in three different forms; in the
form of a bird, Melek Ṭâ´ûs; in the form of an old
man, Šeiḫ ‘Adi; and in the form of a young man,
Yezid. They do not seem to offer him a direct prayer
or sacrifice.</p>


<h4>II<br />

<span class="smcap">The Deity of the Second Degree</span></h4>


<h5>1. <span class="smcap">Melek Ṭâ´ûs</span></h5>

<p>A distinguished modern scholar (see the printed
text, p. 80, lines 12-35) argues that Ṭâ´ûs is the god
Tammuz. His argument is that the word Ṭâ´ûs must
embody an ancient god, but owing to the obscurity in
which the origin of Yezidism and the being of Melek
Ṭâ´ûs are wrapped, it is very difficult to say which
god is meant. And to determine this, he assumes
that the term does not come from the Arabic word
Ṭâ´ûs, but was occasioned by some “folk-etymology,”
and that we must look, therefore, for some god-name
which resembles the word Ṭâ´ûs. Taking this as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
starting point, the critic calls attention to the fact that
in Fihrist, p. 322, l. 27f, which treats of the feasts
and gods of the Ḥarranians, we read that the god
Tauz had a feast in middle of Tammuz. He infers
from this that the god Tauz is identical with Melek
Ṭâ´ûs. And to the question who this god Tauz is, he
answers it is Tammuz. To justify his explanation,
the writer contends that the Yezidis speak in Kurdish,
and according to Justi’s <i>Kurdische Grammatik</i>, p.
82ff, the change of meem to waw in this language is
frequent.<a id="FNanchor_131_131" href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>However plausible this process may seem to be,
philologically it cannot here yield a satisfactory conclusion.
For it is based on wrong premises. It is
not true that the word Ṭâ´ûs signifies an ancient
deity. It denotes the devil and nothing else. This is
so clear to the Yezidis, or to anyone acquainted with
their religion, as to leave no need for further discussion.
And to question the religious consciousness of
a sect is to engage in pure speculation. Likewise, the
method of determining this supposed god by the name
of some deity resembling it is objectionable. There
are many such names. One might also infer that the
sect worship Christ under the form of the devil.
This theory has actually been advanced.—<i>Theatre de
la Turquie</i>, 364. The statement that in Kurdish the
letter meem is changed to waw frequently is untenable,
if one would set it up as a grammatical rule to
explain such phenomena. What is more, the Kurds
pronounce the name tammuz, and nothing else, unless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
some one has a physiological difficulty which will not
permit him to close his lips, so that instead of saying
tammuz, he would mutter taouz. The following are a
few of many instances to show that meem is not
changed to waw in Kurdish, even in words of Arabic
origin: ‘Amelie ṣaliḥ (good works), zamanie aḫerat
(the last day), the well of Zamsam, Mohammed, and
Mustafa (the chosen one), when applied to the
prophet, Melek (king), when applied to Ṭâ´ûs.
Further the assumption that Ṭâ´ûs does not come
from the Arabic Ṭâ´ûs is unverifiable. Unquestionably
the attempt to trace this term to tauz, then to
Tammuz, was suggested to Professor Lidzbarski by
the fact that ammuz was the name of an ancient
Babylonian god, and that Abu Sayyid Wahb ibn
Ibrahim, quoted by an-Nedim, an Arab author of the
tenth century, states that the god Tauz has a feast in
his honor on the fifteenth of Tammuz (<i>Fihrist</i>, p.
322). But according to the author of “<i>Die Sabier und
Sabismus</i>” (p. 202) the original form of this word is
unknown.</p>

<p>Not only the inference which identifies Ṭâ´ûs with
Tammuz is based on wrong premises; but, in the Yezidi
conception of Melek Ṭâ´ûs, there are no traces of the
notion which is held respecting Tammuz. The latter
was originally a sun-god, and son of Ea and the goddess
Sirdu, and the bridegroom of the goddess Ištar.
The legendary poems of Babylonia described him as a
shepherd, cut off in the beauty of youth, or slain by
the boar’s tusk in winter, and mourned for long and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
vainly by the goddess Ištar. The god Tammuz made
his way to Canaan, Cyprus, and thence to Greece.
“He had ceased to be the young and beautiful sun-god,
and had become the representative of the vegetation
of spring, growing by the side of the canals of
Babylonia, but parched and destroyed by the fierce
heat of the summer. Hence in Babylonia his funeral
festival came to be observed in the month of June,
and in Palestine two months later. Tammuz had
changed his character in passing from country to
country, but the idea of him as a slain god, and of his
festival as the idealization of human sorrow, a kind
of “All Souls Day,” was never altered wherever he
was adored.”<a id="FNanchor_132_132" href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> Such beliefs are not found in the
Yezidi view of their King Peacock. On the contrary
his festival is for them the occasion of joy and
pleasure.</p>

<p>I conclude, then, that Ṭâ´ûs is the Arabic word
meaning peacock, just as Melek is the Arabic word
meaning king or angel. The sect write it, pronounce
it, and believe it to be so. The faith of the sect finds
expression in the fact that they represent their angel
Azazil in the form of the peacock.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the real question is not what
Melek Ṭâ´ûs is, but how the devil-god came to be
symbolized by the image of a bird. This question finds
an answer in the fact that the worship of a bird
appears to have been the most ancient of idolatry. It
is condemned especially in Deut. 4: 16, 17:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span> “Lest ye
corrupt yourselves and make a graven image, the
similitude of any figure, the likeness of any winged
fowl that flieth in the air.” And Layard, in his
<i>Nineveh and Its Remains</i>, vol. II, p. 462, gives the
sketch of a bird from one of the slabs dug up at
Nimrud. He remarks that the Iyuges, or sacred birds,
belonged to the Babylonian and probably also to the
Assyrian religion. They were a kind of demons,
who exercised a peculiar influence over mankind,
resembling the feroher of Zoroastrianism. The
oracles attributed to Zoroaster describe them as
powers anointed by God.</p>

<p>Their images, made of gold, were in the palace of
the king of Babylonia. According to Philostratus
they were connected with magic. In Palestine the
dove was sacred for the Phoenicians and Philistines.
The Jews brought accusation against the Samaritans
that they were worshippers of the dove. Sacred
doves were found also at Mecca. Nasar (eagle) was
a deity of the tribe of Ḥamyar.<a id="FNanchor_133_133" href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></p>

<p>A question suggesting itself is how the Yezidi god
came to be designated by the form of a peacock.
This bird is a native of Ceylon, and not of Mesopotamia
or Kurdistan where the Yezidis live.<a id="FNanchor_134_134" href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> The
answer may be found in the Muslim tradition<a id="FNanchor_135_135" href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> that
when the first parents forfeited heaven for eating
wheat, they were cast down upon earth. Eve descended
upon ‘Arafat; Adam at Ceylon; the peacock at
Gabul, and Satan at Bilbays. In this myth the devil
and the peacock are figured as sharing the same
penalty at the same time. According to Surah 2,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
28-31, the crime of the former was pride, but nothing
is said about the guilt of the latter. We learn, however,
from other sources, that the bird in question is
thought of as a symbol of pride. In his article
“Peacock,” in the Enc. Brit., vol. 18, p. 443, Professor
A. Newton says: “The bird is well known as the
proverbial personification of pride. It is seldom kept
in large numbers for it has a bad reputation for doing
mischief in gardens.” Hence we may infer that the
notion of the peacock as a symbol of pride together
with the Koranic idea of Satan’s sin led to the formation
of the myth; that this story was current among
the followers of Yezid bn Unaisa; and that, under
the influence of the devil-worshippers of Persia the
old tradition lost its original significance, and came to
be understood to represent the peacock as a symbol
of the god-devil.</p>

<p>Among the three branches of the deity in the second
degree, Melek Ṭâ´ûs holds an important place in the
theology of the Yezidis. The language used in his
praise is so elevated that one is led to think that he
is identical with God. Some scholars deny this theory
on the ground that the principal prayer of these people
is directed to God and no mention is made of King
Peacock. Hence they contend also that no direct
worship is offered to the latter deity.<a id="FNanchor_136_136" href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> It seems to me
that such a contention is not justifiable. In the first
place, the people themselves confess their loyalty to
the chief angels. Moreover, the expression in this
prayer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span> “Thou hast neither feather, nor wings, nor
arms, nor voice” (see p. <a href='#Page_74'>74</a>) is more applicable to the
symbol Peacock than to God. There can be no doubt,
I think, that in the conception of the sect ‘Azazil
appears to be identical with God. This fact finds
definite expression in the Book of Jilwah. In Chapter
I he is represented as being from eternity to eternity,
as having absolute control of the world, as being
omnipresent and omnipotent and unchangeable. In
Chapter II he is said to appear in divers manners to
the faithful ones; and life and death are determined
by him. And in Chapter III he is declared to be the
source of revelation. While this is true, there are
other phrases which refer to Ṭâ´ûs as being inferior
to the great God, but superior to all other gods. He
was created, and is under the command of God; but
he is made the chief of all.</p>

<p>It is not quite easy to understand the underlying
idea in worshipping the devil. Some<a id="FNanchor_137_137" href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> explain this by
supposing he is so bad that he requires constant
propitiation; otherwise he will take revenge and cause
great misery. For this reason, it is claimed,<a id="FNanchor_138_138" href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> they do
not worship God, because he is so good that he cannot
but forgive. This is the usual interpretation, and it
is confirmed by the nature of the religious service
rendered. It seems to partake much more of a propitiatory
than of a eucharistic character, not as the
natural expression of love but of fear. This reminds
us at once of the Babylonian religion. According to
this religion, when any misfortune overtook the worshippers,
they regarded it as a sign that their deity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
was angry, and had therefore left them to their own
resources or had become their enemy. To be thus
deserted was accounted a calamity because of the
innumerable dangers to which the soul was exposed
from the action of the powers seen and unseen. So
that as a matter of precaution, it was well to maintain
a propitiatory attitude. Hence the great object of
worship was to secure and retain the somewhat
capricious favor of the deity.<a id="FNanchor_139_139" href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> This is in accord with
the natural feeling of man in his primitive state,
which leads him rather to dread punishment for his
sin than to be thankful for blessings received.</p>

<p>Others<a id="FNanchor_140_140" href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> hold that the Devil-worshippers believe
that their Lord is a fallen angel, now suffering a
temporary punishment for his rebellion against the
divine will because he deceived Adam, or because he
did not recognize the superiority of Adam as commanded
by God. But it is not for man to interfere
in the relations of God with his angels, whether they
be fallen or not; on the contrary man’s duty is to
venerate them all alike. The great God will be finally
reconciled to Ṭâ´ûs, and will restore him to his high
place in the celestial hierarchy.</p>

<p>Still others<a id="FNanchor_141_141" href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> assert that the sect does not believe in
an evil spirit but as a true divinity. This theory is not
generally accepted, but seems more probable than the
preceding ones. For there is nothing in the sacred
book to indicate that Melek Ṭâ´ûs is an evil spirit or
a fallen angel. On the contrary the charge that he
was rejected and driven from heaven is repudiated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
The mentioning of his name is looked upon as an
insult to and blasphemy against him because it is
based, the Yezidis think, on the assumption that he
is degraded. Finally, he is declared to be one of the
seven gods, who is now ruling the world for a period
of 10,000 years.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that, in the history of religion,
the god of one people is the devil of another.
In the Avesta, the evil spirits are called daeva
(Persian Div); the Aryans of India, in common with
the Romans, Celts, and Slavs gave the name of dev
(devin, divine, divny) to their good or god-like
spirits. Asura is a deity in the Rig Veda, and an
evil spirit only in later Brahman theology. Zoroaster
thought that the beings whom his opponents worshipped
as gods, under the name of daeva, were in
reality powers by whom mankind are unwittingly led
to their destruction. “In Islam the gods of heathenism
are degraded into jinn, just as the gods of north
semitic heathenism are called šĕirim (hairy demons)
in Lev. 17: 7, or as the gods of Greece and Rome
became devils to the early Christians.”<a id="FNanchor_142_142" href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></p>

<p>The Yezidis’ veneration for the devil in their
assemblies is paid to his symbol, the sanjaḳ. It is the
figure of a peacock with a swelling breast, diminutive
head, and widespread tail. The body is full but the
tail is flat and fluted. This figure is fixed on the top
of a candlestick around which two lamps are placed,
one above the other, and containing seven burners.
The stand has a bag, and is taken to pieces when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
carried from place to place. Close by the stand they
put water jugs filled with water, to be drunk as a
charm by the sick and afflicted. They set the sanjaḳ
at the end of a room and cover it with a cloth. Underneath
is a plate to receive the contributions. The
ḳawwal (sacred musician) kisses the corner of the
cloth when he uncovers Melek-Ṭâ´ûs. At a given
signal, all arise, then each approaches the sanjaḳ,
bows before it and puts his contribution into the plate.
On returning to their places, they bow to the image
several times and strike their breasts as a token of
their desire to propitiate the evil principle.</p>

<p>The Yezidis have seven sanjaḳs, but the Fariḳ
(Lieut.-Gen. of the Turkish Army), who tried to convert
them to Mohammedanism in 1892, took five of
them. Some deny, however, that they were real
ones; they say they were imitations. Each sanjaḳ is
given a special place in the Emir’s palace, where it
is furnished with a small brazen bed and a vessel in
the form of a mortar placed before it. They burn
candles and incense before it day and night. Each
sanjaḳ is assigned a special district, the name of
which is written on a piece of paper and placed on its
shoulder. On the shoulder of the first the district of
Šeiḫan, which comprises the villages around Mosul, is
indicated; on the second Jabal Sinjar; in the third
the district of Ḫalitiyah, which is one of the dependencies
of Diarbeker; on the fourth the district of
Ḫawariyah, <i>i. e.</i>, the Kocḥers; on the fifth the district
of Malliah, the villages around Aleppo; on the sixth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
the district of Sarḥidar, which is in Russia; and the
seventh remains at the tomb of Šeiḫ ‘Adi.</p>

<p>When sent from village to village of its respective
district, a sanjaḳ is put in a hagibah<a id="FNanchor_143_143" href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> (saddle-bag)
and carried on a horse that belongs to a pir (religious
teacher). On nearing a certain place, a messenger is
sent to announce in Kurdish “Sanjaḳ hat,” “the
Sanjaḳ has come.” Then all the people don their
fineries and go out to welcome it with tambourines.
As the representative of Melek Ṭâ´ûs reaches the
town, the pir cries out in Kurdish language, “Sanjaḳ
mevan ki sawa?” (literally: “Whose guest shall the
sanjaḳ be?”). On hearing this, each person makes
a bid for the privilege of entertaining it. Finally he
who bids the highest receives the image. At that
moment the accompanying pir takes the hagibah off
the horse’s back and hangs it on the neck of the
person who is to keep the symbol of the devil over
night.</p>

<p>The Yezidis say, that in spite of the frequent wars
and massacres to which the sect has been exposed,
and the plunder and murder of the priests during
their journeys, no Melek Ṭâ´ûs has ever fallen into
the hands of the Mohammedans. When a ḳawwal
sees danger ahead of him, he buries the Melek Ṭâ´ûs
and afterwards comes himself, or sends some one to
dig up the brazen peacock, and carries it forward in
safety.</p>

<p>Besides revering the devil by adoring his symbol,
the Yezidis venerate him by speaking with great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
respect of his name. They refer to him as Melek
Ṭâ´ûs, King Peacock, or Melek al-ḳawwat, the
Mighty King. They never mention his name; and any
allusion to it by others so irritates and vexes them
that they put to death persons who have intentionally
outraged their feelings by its use. They carefully
avoid every expression that resembles in sound the
name of Satan. In speaking of shatt (river) they use
the common Kurdish word Ave, or the Arabic ma
(water). In speaking of the Euphrates, they call it
Ave ‘Azim, or ma al-kabir, <i>i. e.</i>, the great river, or
simply al-Frat.</p>


<h5>2. Šeiḫ ‘Adî</h5>

<p>Next to the devil in rank comes Šeiḫ ‘Adi. But he
is not the historical person whose biography is given
by the Mohammedan authors. He is identified with
deity and looked upon as a second person in a divine
trinity. He is sent by Melek Ṭâ´ûs to teach and to
warn his chosen people lest they go astray. He is
conceived to be everywhere, to be greater than Christ;
and, like Melek-Ṣedek, has neither father nor mother.
He has not died and will never die. In verse ten of
the poems in his praise, he is distinctly said
to be the only God. His name is associated with
all the myth that human imagination can possibly
create about a deity. To express the Yezidi dogma
in terms of Christian formula, Šeiḫ ‘Adi is the Holy
Spirit, who dwells in their prophets, who are called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
kochaks. He also reveals to them truth and the
mysteries of heaven.</p>

<p>The entertaining of such views has led some
modern critics to think ‘Adi the good and Melek
Ṭâ´ûs the evil principle. In the poem (30-32), he
is represented as the good deity and the source of all
good. Others identify him with Adde or Adi, a
disciple of Manes or Mani. Still others regard his
name as one of the names of the deity. In this case,
his tomb is a myth and the prefix “Šeiḫ” is added to
deceive the Mohammedans, and thus to prevent them
from desecrating the sacred shrine, just as the Christians
call Mar Mattie, Sheikh Mattie, and the convent
of Mar Behnan, ḫuder Elias.<a id="FNanchor_144_144" href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> But the most ingenious
theory is that advanced by the Rev. G. P.
Badger. He queries whether the Yezidi ‘Adi be not
cognate with the Hebrew Ad, the two first letters in
the original of Adonai, the Lord, and its compounds,
Adonijah, Adonibezek. The writer is aware, however,
that “This derivative is open to objection on the
ground that the Yezidis write the word with ‘ain and
not with alif.” But he explains: “They write so only
in Arabic, of which they know but very little, and not
in their own language (Kurdish) in which they do not
write it at all. Moreover, they may have assimilated
the mode of expressing the title of their deity in bygone
days to that of ‘Adi, one of the descendants of
the Merawian Califs, with whom, from fear of being
persecuted by the Mohammedans, they sometimes
identified him.” Having thus expounded his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
view, this English scholar proceeds to repudiate the
suggestion that Šeiḫ ‘Adi “is the same Adi,” one of the
disciples of Mani, since there is no proof, according to
him, that Mani himself was deified by his followers.</p>

<p>So far as the application of the method of comparative
philology is concerned, Badger’s theory is
more reasonable and tenable than that of Lidzbarski,
who, by the same method, attempts to identify Melek
Ṭâ´ûs with Tammuz. Nevertheless, the inference of
the former is beyond any possible justification. For
such a starting-point is misleading when it is not supported
by historical proof. A failure to support it
thus cannot be regarded as other than deficiency in
treatment. Now, while one may be misguided by the
Yezidi myth surrounding the personality of Šeiḫ ‘Adi,
the critical mind can find much in it to aid him in his
efforts to discover the true identity of the man. In
verse fifty of his poem, for our critic draws
his conclusions in the light of this poem, the
Šeiḫ receives his authority from God who is his lord;
in verse fifty-seven he is a man, ‘Adi of Damascus,
son of Musafir; in verse eighty he declares that the
high place which he had attained is attainable by all
who, like him, shall find the truth. To justify my
criticism, I need only ask the reader to recall the
description by the Mohammedan biographers of the
person in question.</p>

<p>The Yezidis offer their worship to Šeiḫ ‘Adi,
usually when they assemble at his shrine. This is his
tomb within a temple. The latter lies in a narrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
valley which has only one outlet, as the rock rises
on all sides except where a small stream forces its
way into a large valley beyond. The tomb stands in
a courtyard, and is surrounded by a few buildings in
which the guardians and the servants of the sanctuary
live. In the vicinity are scattered a number of shacks,
each named after a šeiḫ, and supposed to be his tomb.
Toward sunset these sacred places are illuminated by
burning sesame oil lamps, putting one at the entrance
to each tomb in token of their respect; the light lasts
but a short time. There are also a few edifices, each
belonging to a Yezidi district, in which the pilgrims
reside during the time of the feast; so that each portion
of the valley is known by the name of the country
of those who resort thither. On the lintel of the
doorway of the temple, various symbols are engraved,—a
lion, a snake, a hatchet, a man and a
comb.<a id="FNanchor_145_145" href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> Their mystical meaning is unknown. They
are regarded as mere ornaments placed there at the
request of those who furnished money for building
the temple. The interior of the temple is made up of
an oblong apartment which is divided into three compartments,
and a large hall in the centre which is
divided by a row of columns; and arches support the
roof. To the right of the entrance are a platform,
and a spring of water coming from the rock. The
latter is regarded with great veneration, and is
believed to be derived from the holy well of Zamzam
at Mecca. It is used for the baptism of children and
for other sacred purposes. Close by there are two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
small apartments in which are tombs of the saints and
of some inferior personage. In the principal halls a
few lamps are usually burning, and at sunset lights
are scattered over the walls.</p>

<p>The tomb of Šeiḫ ‘Adi lies in the inner room, which
is dimly lighted. The tomb has a large square cover,
upon which is written Ayat al-Kursi, that is, the
verse of the throne, which is the 256th verse of surat-al-Baḳarah,
or Chapter II of the Koran.</p>

<p>“God. There is no God but He, the Living, the
Abiding. Neither slumber nor sleep seizeth Him.
To Him belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and whatsoever
is on earth. Who is he that can intercede with
Him but by His own permission? He knoweth what
has been before them and what shall be after them;
yet naught of His knowledge do they comprehend,
save what he willeth to reveal. His throne reacheth
over the heavens and the earth, and the upholding of
both burdeneth Him not. He is the High, the Great.”</p>

<p>It is related (in the Mishkat, Book IV, 1. 19, Part
III) that ‘Ali heard Mohammed say in the pulpit,
“That person who repeats the Ayat al-Kursi after
every prayer shall in no wise be prevented from
entering into Paradise, except by life; and whoever
says it when he goes to his bedchamber will be kept
by God in safety together with his house and the
house of his neighbor.” Šeiḫ ‘Adi might have been
in the habit of repeating this verse; and this, perhaps,
led to its inscription on the tomb.</p>

<p>In the center of the inner room, close by the tomb,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
there is a square plaster case, in which are small balls
of clay taken from the tomb. These are sold or distributed
to the pilgrims, and regarded as sacred relics,
useful against disease and evil spirits. It is said that
there are three hundred and sixty lamps in the shrine
of ‘Adi, which are lit every night. The whole valley
in which the shrine lies is held sacred. No impure
thing is permitted within its holy bounds. No other
than the high priest and the chiefs of the sect are
buried near the tomb. Many pilgrims take off their
shoes on approaching it, and go barefooted as long
as they remain in its vicinity.</p>

<p>Such is the sanctuary of ‘Adi, where they offer him
their homage. Their worship may be divided into
two kinds, direct and indirect. The former consists
of traditional hymns sung by the ḳawwals, the sacred
musicians of the sect. They are chanted to the sound
of flutes and tambourines. The tunes are monotonous
and generally loud and harsh. The latter kind consists
in celebrating their religious rites with great
rejoicing on the feast day of their great saint. And
their ḳubla, the place to which they look while performing
their holy ceremonies, is that part of the
heaven in which the sun rises.</p>

<p>The great feast of Šeiḫ ‘Adi is held yearly on April
fifteenth to twentieth, Roman calendar, when the
Yezidis from all their districts come to attend the
festival celebration. Before entering the valley, men
and women perform their ablutions, for no one can
enter the sacred valley without having first purified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
his body and his clothes. The people of the villages
are gathered and start together, forming a long procession,
preceded by musicians, who play the tambourine
and the pipe. They load the donkeys with
necessary carpets and domestic utensils. While
marching they discharge their guns into the air and
sing their war cry. As soon as they see the tower
of the tomb, they all together discharge their arms.</p>

<p>The šeiḫs and the principal members of the priesthood
are dressed in pure white linen, and all are
venerable men with long beards. Only the chief and
the ḳawwals and two of the order of the priesthood
enter the inner court of the temple, and they always
go in barefooted. They start an hour after sunset.<a id="FNanchor_146_146" href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>
The ceremony begins with the exhibition of the holy
symbol of Melek Ṭâ´ûs to the priests. No stranger
is allowed to witness this ceremony or to know the
nature of it. This being done, they begin the rite.
The ḳawwals stand against the wall on one side of the
court and commence a chant. Some play on
the flute, others on the tambourine; and they
follow the measure with their voices. The šeiḫs
and the chiefs form a procession, walking two by two;
the chief priest walks ahead. A faḳir holds in one
hand a lighted torch, and in another a large vessel of
oil, from which he pours into the lamp from time to
time. All are in white apparel except the faḳirs, who
are dressed in black. As they walk in a circle, they
sing in honor of Šeiḫ ‘Adi. Afterward, they sing in
honor of ‘Isa (Jesus). As they proceed the excitement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
increases, the chants quicken, the tambourines are
beaten more frequently, the faḳirs move faster, the
women make tahlil with a great shouting, and the
ceremony comes to an end with great noise and
excitement. When the chanting is ended, those who
were marching in procession kiss, as they pass by, the
right side of the temple entrance, where the serpent
is figured on the wall. Then the emir stands at this
entrance to receive the homage of the šeiḫs and elders
who kiss his hand. Afterward all that are present
give one another the kiss of peace.<a id="FNanchor_147_147" href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> After the ceremony
the young men and women dance in the outer
court until early in the morning.</p>

<p>In the morning the šeiḫs and the ḳawwals offer a
short prayer in the temple without any ceremony and
some kiss the holy places in the vicinity. When they
end, they take the green<a id="FNanchor_148_148" href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> cover of the tomb of Šeiḫ
‘Adi and march with it around the outer court with
music. The people rush to them and reverently kiss
the corner of the cloth, offering money.</p>

<p>After taking the cover back to its place, the chiefs
and priests sit around the inner court. Kochaks at
this time bring food and call the people to eat of the
hospitality of Šeiḫ ‘Adi.<a id="FNanchor_149_149" href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> After they have finished
their meal, a collection is taken for the support of the
temple and tomb of their saint. All people that come
to the annual festival bring dishes as offerings to their
living šeiḫ. After he has indicated his acceptance
of them by tasting, these are given to the servants of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
the sanctuary. When the feast comes to an end, the
people return to their several abodes.</p>


<h5>(3.) <span class="smcap">Yezid</span></h5>

<p>The third essential element in the religion of the
devil-worshippers is the belief that their sect has
taken its origin from Yezid, whom frequently they
call God and regard as their ancestral father, to whom
they trace their descent. No other worship is offered
him. He is given, however, a place of honor in the
court of the temple, where, on one side, there is the
inscription “Melek Yezid, the mercy of God be upon
him”; on the other side “Šeiḫ ‘Adi, the mercy of God
be upon him.” In the corner of this court a lamp is
kept burning all night in honor of the two.</p>

Mr. Badger seems to contend that the Kurdish-speaking
people do not pronounce the letter ‘ain. This
is not true, the Kurds pronounce this letter as well as
other gutturals. They sometimes even change the
Arabic Alif to ‘ain. This is to be said, however, that in
some localities the ‘ain is pronounced alif, just as the
ḳaf is changed to alif, but this is not confined to the
Kurds, such changes are made by the Arabic-and the
Syriac-speaking people also.</p></div>

<small><span class="smcap">Other Deities and Festivals</span></small></h3>


<h4>I<br />

<span class="smcap">The So-Called Seven Divinities</span></h4>

<p>Besides their great saint, the Yezidis believe in
seven other šeiḫs through whose intermediation they
invoke God. These are also deified and assigned
places of honor at Šeiḫ ‘Adi’s side. In their case as
in that of their chief, the tradition has led some
critics to believe that they are archangels; others,
different attributes of God; and still others, the seven
Amshaps of Zoroaster, or immortal spirits of the
Avesta. The last conjecture is made by Victor
Dingelstadt.<a id="FNanchor_150_150" href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> Cholsohn goes a step further in
making the assertion, “Der Tempel des sheikh Shams
ist ohne allen Zweifel ein Sonnentempel der so
gebaut ist, dass die ernsten Strahlen der Sonne so
häufig als möglich auf ihn fallen.” The ground for
this positive statement is, we are told “Layard
berichtet.”<a id="FNanchor_151_151" href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> Now, the English scholar seems to base
his contention on the fact that the building is called
the sanctuary of Šeiḫ Šams; that the herd of white
oxen which are slain on great festivals at Šeiḫ ‘Adi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>’s
are dedicated to Šams; “that the dedication of the bull
to the sun” was generally recognized in the religious
system of the ancients, which probably originated in
Assyria; and that the Yezidis may have unconsciously
preserved a myth of their ancestors.<a id="FNanchor_152_152" href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> To my
mind the ground for such a view is the apriori assumption
that the religion of the devil-worshippers is the
remnant of an ancient cult, and that every phenomenon
in it is to be regarded, therefore, a survival of
the past system. For certain reasons I hold that such
is not the case.</p>

<p>One reason, as Badger rightly remarks, the
Yezidis so designate the place for the sake of
brevity, is the entablature over the doorway records
the name in full, “Sheikh Shams Ali Beg and Faris.”
Two persons are mentioned in the inscription.<a id="FNanchor_153_153" href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> In
like manner, the word Šams frequently enters into the
construction of Mohammedan names. The most
celebrated one that bore this name was Šams ud-Din
of Tabriz, the friend and spiritual guide of Jalal ad-Din,
who flourished during the first half of the 13th
century of our era.</p>

<p>Moreover, round about the tomb of Šeiḫ ‘Adi are
many such abandoned shrines, each of which is
dedicated to a similar deified šeiḫ. Many of these
šeiḫs are known to be historical personages. Take
for example, Šeiḫ ‘Abd al-ḳadir of Gilan. He is
Šeiḫ Muḥiyy ud Din ‘Abd al ḳadir of Gilan in
Persia, the founder of the ḳadiri order of dervishes.
He was born in <span class="smcap lowercase">A. H.</span> 471 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 1078-9) and died<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
<span class="smcap lowercase">A. H.</span> 516 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 1164-5). So also Šeiḫ ḳaḍib al-Ban.
He was from Mosul, and was a contemporary of
Šeiḫ ‘Adi. In giving the life of Muḥi ad Din aš-Šharnozuri,
Ibn Ḫallikan (v. 2,651) says, “His corpse
was removed to a mausoleum built for its reception
outside the Maidan Gate of Mosul, near the tomb of
ḳadib al-Ban, the celebrated worker of miracles.”
Further, Manṣur al-Ḥallaj was a celebrated mystic,
revered as a saint by the more advanced sufis. He
was put to death with great cruelty at Bagdad in
<span class="smcap lowercase">A. H.</span> 309 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 921-2) on a charge of heresy and
blasphemy, because he had said in one of his ecstacies,
“Ana-l-Ḥaḳḳ, I am the truth, God.” All biographers
of sufi saints speak of him with admiration.</p>

<p>There are still others who are mentioned even
among the seven šeiḫs enumerated in the principal
prayer. Šeiḫ Ḥasan (written also Šeiḫisin) was
from Baṣrah. He was a celebrated theologian and
died in <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 728. His life is given by Ibn Ḫallikan.
He was noted for self-mortification, fear of God and
devotion. And Faḫr ad-Din is ibn Abd Allah
Mohammed Ibn Amar al-Ḥuṣain Ibn al-Ḥasan, Ibn
‘Ali Al-Taim al-Bakri al-Taberstani ar-kai-zi (native
of Kai in Tabarestan), surnamed Faḫr ad-Din
(glory of faith). He was a doctor of the Shafite sect,
a pearl of his age, a man without a peer. He surpassed
all his contemporaries in scholastic theology,
and preached both in Arabic and Persian. He would
draw floods of tears from his eyes. His virtues and
merits were boundless. He was born at Kai, 25th of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
Ramadan, <span class="smcap lowercase">A. H.</span> 544 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 1150), and died at Ḥerat,
the first of Shawal, <span class="smcap lowercase">A. H.</span> 606 (March <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 1210).
(See ibn Ḫallikan in loco.)</p>

<p>In the light of these facts, I conclude, then, that
those who cannot be identified—for many bear the
same name, and we do not know which is which—are
also historical personages.</p>

<p>This is what I mean by the statement that in order
to yield satisfactory results the inductive method
must be supported by historical investigations.</p>

<p>In a question like this, however, the philosophical
method also, when carried on critically, may yield a
satisfactory result. Accordingly, observations should
be made in the sphere of religious consciousness.
Now one of the characteristics of the human mind is
the tendency to defy man. This is shown in the
titles which men gave to their superiors. In the Tell-al-Amarna
tablets, we find various kinglets of Syria,
in writing to the king of Egypt, address him as “my
gods” (ilani-ia). Thus Abimilki of Tyre writes: “To
my lord, the king, my son, my god.” What is more,
a superhuman character is attributed to the dead.
This appears from the attitude which the primitive
mind entertained towards the deceased. At first, the
relation to the dead was hostile, hence their spirits
were feared. Gradually, the relation became familiar,
so that their association was sought and sacrifices and
gifts were offered to them. They came to be looked
upon as elohim, who knew the future events. Thus
we find that in the Old Testament, worship was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
offered to the dead, and that the tombs of ancestors
and heroes frequently appear as places of worship,
as, <i>e. g.</i>, the grave of Miriam at Kadish (Num. 26: 1).
Even to-day tombs of saints are common in Arabia,
and thousands of people visit them annually to
ask the intercession of the saints. Likewise, the
Nuṣairiyeh of Syria have deified ‘Ali, the Drus their
chief Hakim, the Babis their Beha, and the Christians
their saints.<a id="FNanchor_154_154" href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> We cannot, therefore, be surprised that
the Yezidis have deified their šeiḫs and heroes. They
have only shown that common trait of the mind—the
tendency to deify man.</p>

<p>It is to be noticed, further, that in the historical
development of religions we find that when the stage
of the mere belief in spirits is past, individual deities
stand out from the great mass of the spirits, and these
are plainly imagined to be personal gods, such as
Astarte and Ba‘al by the side of Hadad and
Aschirat.<a id="FNanchor_155_155" href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> Now this is practically what we find in
the evolution of modern Yezidism. Out of many
šeiḫs and murids, seven, next to šeiḫ ‘Adi, stand out
as individual divinities.</p>

<p>Yearly festivals in honor of these šeiḫs are commemorated
in April at different villages with the same
rites as those observed at Šeiḫ ‘Adi’s tomb. Lamps
are nightly lighted and left to burn in the shacks called
after the names of their respective šeiḫs; and in those
to which a room is attached, ḳawwals assemble at
sunset every Tuesday and Thursday, when they burn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
incense over each tomb; and after watching a short
time, and smoking their pipes, they return home.</p>

<p>An interesting festival is that of Šeiḫ Mohammed,
celebrated by the people of Ba‘šiḳa, where his tomb
exists. They say that they are solemnizing the
nuptials of Šeiḫ Mohammed, whom they believe to be
married once a year. The men and women dance
together while the ḳawwals play on their flutes and
tambourines. They bring Melek Ṭâ´ûs in procession
from Baḥazanie to Ba‘šiḳa amid rejoicing and sound
of music. Two pirs precede the bearer of the sacred
peacock, carrying in their hands lighted candles
which they move to and fro. As they pass along the
bystanders bow in adoration and, immersing their
hands in the smoke, perfume with it their arms and
faces. They carry the image of Melek Ṭâ´ûs to the
house of the one who is the highest bidder for the
honor of entertaining it. Here it remains two days,
during which all profane festivals are suspended and
visits are paid to it.</p>


<h4>II<br />

<span class="smcap">The Day of Sarsal</span></h4>

<p>In addition to the festivals mentioned above is the
one observed on New Year’s day, the first Wednesday
in April. On this day, the Yezidis say, no drums are
to be beaten, for God sits on the throne, holding a
conference at which he decrees the events of the year.
They also stick wild scarlet anemones to the entrance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
of their houses. The refraining from the sound of
instruments of pleasure on the part of orientals signifies
a state of contrition. Hence, it is very likely
that the Yezidis entertain the view that on this day
God is decreeing their destiny for the coming year;
that they must now, therefore, adjust their relation
to him with sincere sorrow for sin. If this is so, the
significance of the hanging of the flowers at the
entrance of their houses can be taken as intended to
propitiate the Evil Principle, and to ward off calamity
during the coming year. Such a belief has a parallel
in many religions. According to Babylonian mythology
human destiny was decreed on New Year’s day
and sealed on the tenth day thereafter. It was therefore
necessary to placate the deity, or at least to make
sure of one’s relation to him, before this particular
day. The New Year period was held, therefore, to be
of special importance because of the bearing on individual
welfare by reason of the good or the evil
decision of the gods. Our modern custom of wishing
our friends a Happy New Year has perhaps some connection
with this idea.<a id="FNanchor_156_156" href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></p>

<p>The Day of Atonement (Lev. 23: 27; 25: 29) had
a most important place in the Jewish ecclesiastical
year. This was the occasion of a thorough purification
of the whole nation and of every individual
member thereof in their relation to Yahweh. It was
designed to deepen afresh the national and individual
sense of sin and dread of the judgment of God.
According to Talmud (Mišna, Roš hašana, vol. I, 2)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
Roš hašana is the most important judgment day, on
which all creatures pass for judgment before the
Creator. On this day, three books are opened
wherein the fate of the wicked, the righteous and
those of the intermediate class are recorded. Hence
prayer and works of repentance are performed on the
New Year from the first to the tenth that an unfavorable
decision might be averted (Jewish Ency.,
art. Penitential Day). R. Akiba says: “On New
Year Day all men are judged; and the degree is sealed
on the Day of Atonement (Ibid, art. Day of Judgment).</p>

<p>Moreover, the red lilies of the doors of the Yezidis
remind us at once of the blood sprinkled on the doorposts
of the dwellings of the Israelites in Egypt as a
sign for the Destroying Angel to pass over. This
notion is found also in a similar practice among the
Parsees of India, who hang a string of leaves across
the entrances to their houses at the beginning of every
new year.</p>

<p>In the light of what has been said, the Yezidis’ idea
in giving food to the poor at the grave on the day of
Sarsal (New Year day), is to propitiate God on behalf
of the dead, who are, according to their belief,
reincarnated in some form or other.<a id="FNanchor_157_157" href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></p>

<h4>I<br />

<span class="smcap">Sacraments</span></h4>

<p>Circumcision, the Eucharist and baptism are the
three religious rites administered by the followers of
Yezid. The first rite is optional. But with baptism
the case is different; it is a matter of obligation.
When a child is born near enough to the tomb of Šeiḫ
‘Adi to be taken there without great inconvenience or
danger, it should be baptized as early as possible after
birth. The ḳawwals in their periodical visitations
carry a bottle or skin filled with holy water to baptize
those children who cannot be brought to the shrine.
The mode of baptism is as follows: A šeiḫ carries
the baby into the water, takes off his clothes, and
immerses him three times. After the second time,
putting his hand on the child’s head, he mutters, “Hol
hola soultanie Azid, tou bouia berḫe Azid, saraka rea
Azid.” (“Hol hola!<a id="FNanchor_158_158" href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> Yezid is a sultan. Thou hast
become a lamb of Yezid; thou mayest be a martyr for
the religion of Yezid.”) The parents are not admitted
to the domed shack of the spring; they remain out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>side.
The šeiḫ is paid for his services by the father
of the child. If the baby be a male, the gift must be
more valuable than if it be a female.</p>

<p>Within twenty days from the time of baptism, a
male child is circumcised. To perform the rite, two
šeiḫs are employed. One holds the child in his lap,
the other performs the operation. Before starting, he
asks the child to say: “As berḫe Azide Sarum.” (“I
am the lamb of illuminating Yezid.”) If he be too
small to repeat, the šeiḫ who holds him repeats the
sentence for him. All this is done in the presence of
the parents, the relatives and the friends, amid
rejoicing with the sound of the flute and the tambourine.
When the ceremony is ended, the father of
the child entertains all those present for seven successive
days, during which period they dance, sing
and eat the food sent to them by the friends and
neighbors of the circumcised child. When this comes
to an end, the two šeiḫs are presented with gifts.
Then every one returns home. The reason why they
observe the two rites, they say, is that if one does not
work the other may, and neither is harmful.</p>

<p>As to the Eucharist,<a id="FNanchor_159_159" href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> its observance is local. It is
usually administered by the Yezidis of a place called
Ḫalitiyeh, a dependency of Diarbeker. It is observed
in the following manner: They sit around a table.
The chief among them holding a cup of wine, asks in
Kurdish, “Ave Chia.” (“What is this?”) Then he
himself answers, “Ave Kasie ‘Isaya.” (“This is the
cup of Jesus.”) He continues, “Ave ‘Isa naf<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
rounishtiya.” (“Jesus is sitting and present in it.”)
Having first partaken himself, he passes the cup
around. The last person drinks all that is left in the
cup.</p>

<p>There is another sacrament among the Yezidis. I
refer to the rite of repentance. When persons
quarrel, the guilty one, covering his face with his
hands, betakes himself to the most venerable šeiḫ to
confess his sin. The latter, giving the penitent
instructions, enjoins him to kiss the hands of his
enemy and those of the members of the priesthood.
This having been done, if still no reconciliation be
effected, the offending person, whoever he may be,
must undergo again the same exercises. When peace
is established, the penitent one slaughters a sheep and
offers wine to the reconciled one and the clerical body.
This rite of repentance, however, is not obligatory.<a id="FNanchor_160_160" href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p>


<h4>II<br />

<span class="smcap">Some Other Religious Practices</span></h4>

<p>Fasting is one of the religious observances. It is
kept for three successive days in the month of December,
when they profess to commemorate the death of
Yezid. Some observe also the forty days’ fast in the
spring of the year, when the Eastern Christians celebrate
the memory of Christ’s abstinence from food
at the time of his temptation in the wilderness. One
person in a family may fast for the rest. During this
period fasters abstain from animal food. The chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
šeiḫ fasts rigidly one month in the year, eating only
once in twenty-four hours and immediately after
sunset.</p>

<p>Prayer is not considered a religious duty. They
never pray; they do not even have a form of prayer,
and acknowledge that they do not pray. It is said
that when Šeiḫ ‘Adi came from Mecca, he told his
followers in one of his sermons: “God commanded
me to tell you that there is no need of prayer; believe
in the power of Melek Ṭâ´ûs and ye shall be saved.“
They have, however, what is called morning recital,
which the devout among them mutters in Kurdish as
he rises up from his bed. It is as follows:</p>

<h4>III<br />

<span class="smcap">The Sacerdotal Orders</span></h4>

<p>The hierarchical orders of the Yezidi sect are four.
The head šeiḫ is the patriarch of the sect. He directs
all the religious affairs of the community and leads
them in their rites. He is also the principal interpreter
of their religion, the chief spiritual judge, a
sacred person, whose hearth is regarded as a sanctuary,
only second in importance to Šeiḫ ‘Adi’s temple,
and whose will must be obeyed. His powerful
weapon is excommunication. He presides over a
tribunal composed of ecclesiastical superiors, which
has jurisdiction in religious offences, in questions
relating to marriage, and in disputes between the
clergy. His charge is hereditary, in direct succession;
but if his eldest son be considered unworthy, he may
appoint another to succeed him. He is said to be
descended from Šeiḫ ‘Adi, and is believed to be
endowed with supernatural power for healing diseases,
and for blessing cattle and crops. Twice a
year he visits the neighboring villages to collect contributions,
and sends his ḳawwals to far distant districts
for the same purpose. Occasionally he takes
part in celebrating the marriage of persons of distinction
in his community. He is also at times solicited to
preside over funeral rites, which are generally conducted
by the ḳawwals and šeiḫs. The chief šeiḫ
wears a black turban and white garments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span></p>

<p>Besides the head šeiḫ, the Yezidis have many other
šeiḫs. Each has a parish to look after. Twice a year
he visits his parishioners to receive their free-will
offerings. If a member of a congregation does not
satisfy his šeiḫ, he is anathematized by his spiritual
leader, and no one will speak to him or eat with him.
Every one of these šeiḫs is supposed to possess a
special power, such as the power to drive scorpions
away by praying over water and sprinkling it in the
corners of the house. They have one called Šeiḫ
Deklie, that is, Šeiḫ of the Cocks. His office is to go
from village to village to collect chickens. Several of
these šeiḫs always reside at Šeiḫ ‘Adi’s.</p>

<p>The next in dignity are pirs, from the Persian
meaning an old man. They wear red turbans and
black garments. Then come the ḳawwals, from the
Arabic, meaning one who speaks fluently, an orator.
And lastly, the fakirs, from the Arabic poor. These
are the lowest order in the Yezidi priesthood. (For
the different offices of the last three orders, (see p.
<a href='#Page_69'>69</a>.)</p>

<p>The clergy of all ranks enjoy particular respect.
Their persons and homes are held inviolate. They
take precedence at public gatherings. And the šeiḫs
and pirs possess the much dreaded power of excommunication.</p>

<p>Besides the above, the Yezidis have a temporal
chief, who is called amir. His dignity is also hereditary
and confined to one family. He is believed to be
a descendant of Yezid. He exercises a secondary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
authority over the Yezidis. He is a mediator between
his sect and the Turkish government. He has the
power to cut off any refractory member from the
community. He has charge of fifty ḳawwals who try
to collect for him at their annual visits to each
Yezidi district a certain amount of money. The
money received by them is divided into two equal
parts, one of which goes to the support of the tomb of
Šeiḫ ‘Adi, and the second part is divided, one-half
being for the amir, the other half being shared equally
by the ḳawwals.</p>

<p>The name of the present amir is ‘Ali, and he resides
in Ba‘adrie.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Their Customs</span></small></h3>


<h4>I<br />

<span class="smcap">Marriage</span></h4>

<p>The Yezidis are endogamic. They forbid union
between the secular and the religious classes, as also
within certain degrees of relationship. A šeiḫ’s son
marries only a šeiḫ’s daughter; so pirs’ sons, pirs’
daughters. A layman cannot marry a šeiḫ’s or a pir’s
daughter, but he may take for a wife a ḳawwal’s or
a kochak’s daughter; and ḳawwals’ or kochaks’ sons
may marry laymen’s daughters. But if a layman
marries a šeiḫ’s or a pir’s daughter, he must be killed.
Marriage is for life, but it is frequently dissolved,
divorce being as easy to obtain among them as among
Moslems. When a man wants to get rid of his wife,
he simply lets her go. Polygamy is allowed, but
usually confined to rich men, who generally have two
wives. The number of wives is limited to six, except
for the amir. A man must have money or cattle in
order to be able to get married. The price is called
ḳalam. A respectable girl will not sell herself at a
low price. Parents get rich if they have several pretty
girls; they are the father’s property. The ḳalam,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
dowry, is usually thirty sheep or goats, or the price
of them. The man must give presents to the relatives
of his bride, parents, brothers, etc. If a couple love
each other and cannot marry because the man has no
money to pay his sweetheart’s father, then they elope.
They usually make arrangements before elopement as
to where they will stay for a few weeks to escape
detection. Some strong men accompany them when
they elope. The father of the girl with his relatives
follow. If they catch the fugitives, bloodshed may
ensue. But if they succeed in escaping, they return
after some time and are then forgiven. According to
a Kurdish proverb everything is pardoned the brave.</p>

<p>The couple choose one another. The girl informs
her mother that she loves so and so. The latter
informs her husband. The father acquaints the father
of the young man with the fact. When they agree,
and the daughter is given to the young man, his kindred
come to the house of the bride’s father on an
appointed day, and give the girl a ring; then they
dance, rejoice all night, play, wrestle, and eat black
raisins. After that the young couple are allowed to
arrange nuptial meetings in the company of a matron,
who is presented with a gift.</p>

<p>When the time of marriage comes, the family of the
bridegroom invites the relatives. Each takes with him
a silk handkerchief as a present for the bride. For
three days they drink “ărak,” sing and dance to the
sound of flutes and drums at the house of the young
man. After that, the women, two by two, ride on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
horseback together, and likewise the men. The men
take with them their children, who ride behind them.
In this manner they go to the bride’s house, discharging
their guns as they proceed. When they reach the
house they all discharge their guns together. Hearing
the sound, the father comes out and according to
the custom, asks the visitors what they want. They
respond “Your daughter,” all answering at once.
Then he goes in and tells his wife. After putting
upon their daughter a scarlet ḫailiyah (veil), which
covers her from head to foot, they bring her out.
Everyone of the children takes a spoon from the
bride’s house and sticks it in his turban. After being
brought to the house of the bridegroom, the bride is
kept behind a curtain in the corner of a darkened
room for three days, and the young man is not
allowed to see her during this period.</p>

<p>On the third day, the bridegroom is sought early in
the morning, and led in triumph by his friends from
house to house, receiving at each a small present. He
is then placed within a circle of dancers, and the
guests and bystanders wetting small coins stick them
to his forehead. The money is collected as it falls in
an open handkerchief held by his companions. After
this ceremony a number of the young men, who have
attached themselves to the bridegroom, lock the most
wealthy of their companions in a dark room until they
are willing to pay a ransom for their release. The
money thus taken is added to the dowry of the newly
married couple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></p>

<p>On the evening of the third day the šeiḫ takes the
bridegroom to the bride. Putting the hand of one in
that of the other, and covering the couple with a
ḫailiyah, he asks the bride, “Who are you?” “I am
the daughter of so and so,” responds she. Then he
asks the bridegroom the same question. After receiving
an answer, the šeiḫ asks, “Will you take this young
woman as a wife,” and “Do you want this young man
as a husband?” After hearing each say “Yes,” the
šeiḫ marks their shoulders and foreheads with red ink,
and hands them a stick. As each holds one end of it,
he asks them to break it in the middle, leaving one-half
in the hand of each. Then the šeiḫ says, “So you
remain one until death breaks you asunder.”</p>

<p>When this is done, he takes the couple to a room
and locks them in, waiting at the door. After a while
the bridegroom knocks at the door three times.
Understanding the signal, the priest discharges his
gun, and all the bystanders outside follow his example.
After shouting and dancing for some time,
the šeiḫ sends them home. When they first meet, the
newly wedded husband strikes his young wife with a
small stone as a token of his superiority over her.
For seven days, they stay at home and do no work.
Now, if the husband dies first, the wife goes to her
father’s house.</p>

<p>With the Yezidis, the family bonds are stronger
than those of the tribe. The family proper consists of
parents and their children, married, and unmarried,
living in the same house. Respect for parents and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
elder persons is considered a virtue, as it is among
all the eastern people. The head of the family is the
sole proprietor of the possessions of the family, and
holds full control over his wife and children, who are
bound to obey him. Only personal objects and dress
are the property of the wife. He can punish his wife
and the children. If a son leaves his father’s house,
he is beyond the father’s authority, but not beyond
his moral influence. A father is to maintain his
family, defend it, and answer charges brought against
its members. Next to the father in authority stands
the eldest son.</p>

<p>Women are inferior to men; married women must
obey their husbands. They work like men; they till
the ground, take care of cattle, fight the enemy and
are courageous and very independent. This enables
the young women to choose their sweethearts and run
away with them. They converse with men freely. A
woman does not conceal her face unless she is stared
at, when she draws a corner of her mantle over her
face.</p>

<p>Married women are dressed entirely in white, and
their shirt is of the same cut as the man’s, with a
white kerchief under their chin, and another over
their heads, held by the ‘agal or woollen cord of the
Bedouins. The girls wear white skirts and drawers,
and over them colored zabouns, long dresses open in
front and confined at the waist by a girdle ornamented
with pieces of silver. They bind fancy kerchiefs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
around their heads and adorn themselves with coins
as well as with glass and amber beads.</p>

<p>The men wear shirts closed up to the neck, and their
religious law forbids them to wear the common eastern
shirts open in front. Their shirt is the distinctive
mark by which the Yezidi sect is recognized at once.
They are clothed besides with loose trousers and
cloaks, both of white, and with a black turban, from
beneath which their hair falls in ringlets. They
usually carry long rifles in their hands, pistols in their
girdles, and a sword at their side.</p>

<p>In their physical characteristics they are like the
Kurds, wild, rough, uncultured. They are muscular,
active, and capable of bearing great hardship. In
general, they are a fine, manly race: tall or of medium
stature, with large chest; strong deep voice, audible
afar; clear, keen eye; frank and confident, or fierce
and angry; nose of moderate length, and fairly small
head. Their legs are rather short, but the soles of
their feet are large. Their complexion is usually dark
and their eyes are black. But there are different
types. The predominant type is tall, with black hair,
fine regular nose, and bluish brown eyes. The rest
are of shorter stature, with longer features; light,
bright eyes; and large, irregular nose. The Yezidis
sometime shave the hair off their head, leaving only
a long, thin forelock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>


<h4>II<br />

<span class="smcap">Funerals</span></h4>

<p>If a young or well-known man dies, they make in
his likeness a wooden form and clothe it in the dead
man’s clothes. Then the musicians play mourning
tunes, while the relatives stand round the model.
After wailing for a while, they walk in procession in
a circle around the form, and now and then kneel
down to receive a blessing from it. Those who come
to the scene, according to their custom, ask the
parents of the dead man, “What have you?” They
reply, “We have the wedding of our son.” They
continue wailing for three days. Afterward they distribute
food on behalf of the dead. For a year they
give a plate of food with a loaf of bread daily to some
person, thinking that thereby they are feeding their
own dead. On the seventh and fortieth day from the
time of death, they visit the grave to mourn over their
lost one. Now, if the dead be a common man, he is
not honored with such a ceremony. He is usually
buried an hour or two after his death.</p>

<p>The funeral rites are simple. The body of the
Yezidi, like that of a Mohammedan, is washed in
running water. After being laid on a flat board, they
dress him with his former clothes, close the openings
in his body with pieces of cotton, place the sacred
clay of Šeiḫ ‘Adi in his mouth, on his face and forehead,
under his shoulders and eyes, and on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
stomach. This done, they carry the dead on the board
to the cemetery. The ḳawwals, burning incense, lead
the procession; the immediate relatives, especially the
women, following, dressed in white and throwing
dust over their heads, and accompanied by male and
female friends and neighbors. If the dead be a man,
they then dance, the mother or the wife holding in
one hand the sword or shield of the dead, and in the
other, long locks cut from her own hair. They bury
him with his face turned toward the north star.
Everyone present throws a little dust over the grave
while saying, “O man, thou wert dust and hast
returned to dust to-day.” Then the šeiḫ says, “When
we say, ‘Let us rise and go home,’ then the dead man
will say, ‘I will not go home with the people.’ And
when he tries to get up, his head will strike the stone,
when he will say, ‘O, I am among the dead.’” When
they return home, the family slaughters oxen and
sheep and gives meat to the poor. The poor kill four
or five sheep; the rich, a hundred. The kochaks
prophesy of the dead, whether he will return to the
earth or will go to another world.</p>

<p>They hold that some will be eternally condemned,
but that all will spend an expiatory period; and that
the dead have communion with the living, in which
the good souls dwelling in the heavens make revelations
to their brethren on earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>


<h4>III<br />

<span class="smcap">Nationality</span></h4>

<p>Four different theories have been advanced as to
the race to which the Yezidis belong. There are those
who think them to be of Indo-European origin, for
there is a type among them that has a white skin, a
round skull, blue eyes and light hair. And there are
those who suppose them to be Arabs on the ground
that the color of skin of another type is brown, their
eyes are wide, their lips are thick and their hair is
dark. The western writers, moreover, have in the
past always taken them for Kurds because of the
close resemblance of the two in appearance and manners.
In his “La Turquie d’Asie,” Vital Cunet says
that though the Yezidis have been taken for Kurds,
they can no longer be regarded as such, for in many
ways they resemble other nationalities. On the other
hand Hormuzd Rassam, in his “Asshur and the Land
of Nimrud” seems to agree with those who suppose
them to be of Assyrian origin. He bases this inference
on the independent and martial spirit which they
possess, and their tendency to rebel against their
oppressors, which, according to him, may be taken
as an indication of ancestral inheritance.<a id="FNanchor_162_162" href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>


<h4>IV<br />

<span class="smcap">Locality</span></h4>

<p>The Yezidis dwell principally in five districts, the
most prominent among these being that of Šeiḫan.
This term is the Persian plural of šeiḫ, an old man;
and it signifies the country where šeiḫs dwell. This
district lies northeast of Mosul, covering a wide area
in which are many villages. It is their Palestine. In
it lies their Mecca, Lalish, where their sacred shrine,
the tomb of Šeiḫ ‘Adi, is. Lališh is the centre of their
national and religious life. It is situated in a deep,
picturesque valley. Its slopes are covered with a
dense wood, and at the bottom of it runs the sacred
water. Other notable places here are the two adjoining
villages, Ba‘ašiḳa and Baḥazanie, at the foot of
the mountain of Rabban Hormuzd, a six hours’ ride
from Mosul. The former is the center of the tombs
of their šeiḫs; the latter is their principal burial place,
to which bodies are carried from all the various districts.
It was formerly a Christian village with a
monastery. And Ba‘adrie, northeast of the City of
Mosul, about ten hours’ ride away, is the village where
their amir resides. It is close to Šeiḫ ‘Adi’s.</p>

<p>Next in importance is Jabal Sinjar. The term
“Sinjar” is Persian, meaning a bird, perhaps an eagle.
It signifies that its inhabitants are, like the eagle, safe
and cannot be caught.<a id="FNanchor_163_163" href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> Sinjar is about three days’
journey from Mosul. It is a solitary range, fifty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
miles long and nine miles broad, rising in the midst of
the desert. From its summit, the eye ranges on one
side over the vast level wilderness stretching to the
Euphrates, and on the other over the plain bounded
by the Tigris and the lofty mountains of Kurdistan.
Nisibin and Mardin are both visible in the distance.
One can see the hills of Ba‘adrie and Šeiḫ ‘Adi.
Among the sacred places of this district are two
villages: Assofa, where two ziarahs are found, and
distinguished from afar by their white spires, and
Aldina, where one ziarah exists. In almost every
Sinjar village, there is to be found a covered water
which they use as a fortress during their fights with
the Kurds or with the Turkish army. The devil-worshippers
of this locality are commonly called
Yezidis, while those of Šeiḫan are known both as
Yezidis and Dawaseni.</p>

<p>Another district is Ḫalitiyeh, which includes all the
territory north and northeast of the Tigris in the
province of Diarbeker. The Malliyeh region includes
all the territory west of the Euphrates and Aleppo.
And the Saraḥdar section includes the Caucasus in
southern Russia. Some regard the Lepchos of India
also as Yezidis, who, in the early appearance of the
sect, went there to proselyte the Hindoos.<a id="FNanchor_164_164" href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>


<h4>V<br />

<span class="smcap">Dwellings</span></h4>

<p>In regard to their dwellings, the Yezidis are divided
into two classes: Ahl al-ḥaḍar, the people of the
villages or cultivated land, and Ahl al Wabar, the
people of the tents. The villages are built of clay,
stone or mud, and unburned brick. A village consists
of about sixty houses. A house is divided into three
principal rooms, opening one into another. These are
separated by a wall about six feet high, upon which
are placed wooden pillars supporting the ceiling. The
roof rests on trunks of trees raised on rude stones in
the centre chamber, which is open on one side to the
air. The sides of the room are honeycombed with
small recesses like pigeon-holes. The whole is plastered
with white plaster, fancy designs in red being
introduced here and there. The houses are kept neat
and clean. They say that cleanliness is next to
heaven.</p>

<p>Now, the people of the tents are, like the Arab
Bedouins, nomadic, having no houses and no permanent
place of abode. They form but a small portion
of the Yezidis, and are called Kotchar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span></p>


<h4>VI<br />

<span class="smcap">The Language</span></h4>

<p>The language of the Yezidis, in common with the
Kurds, is Kurdish, which belongs to the Iranian
group of the Indo-European or Indo-Germanic stock.
This Kurmanji possesses a number of dialects not
differing much from one another, except the zaza
dialect, which is spoken in eastern Mesopotamia by
the Kurds, called Ali Alla. The main characteristic
of the Kurmangi are the great brevity of its words
and the simplicity of its grammatical forms. It is
fairly rich in vowels, and richer in deep guttural
sounds. Though Kurdish is the general language of
the Yezidis, their religious mysteries are in Arabic.
Both languages are spoken by those living in the
Sinjar hills and in Šeiḫan.</p>


<h4>VII<br />

<span class="smcap">Occupation</span></h4>

<p>Generally speaking, the Yezidis are an industrious
people, but they do not engage in business. This is
due to their belief that any form of business leads to
cheating and lying, and hence to cursing Melek-Ṭâ´ûs,
<i>i. e.</i>, the devil. Their usual occupation is agriculture
and cattle-raising. The Yezidis of Sinjar, who constitute
almost the entire population, raise fruit, such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
as figs and grapes; also almonds and nuts. Jabal
Sinjar is famous for its figs. Those who live in the
Russian territory, like the sweeper class of India, are
mainly engaged in menial work. But those in the
districts of Reḍwan and Midyat are given to housebreaking
and highway robbery; they are the terror of
those regions.</p>

<p>The Yezidis seldom appear in the cities; and when
they do they conceal their peculiarities as much as
possible, for the Christians and Mohammedans are
wont to seek amusement at their expense. When
they find a Yezidi in their company, they draw a
circle about him on the ground, from which he superstitiously
believes he cannot get out, until some one
breaks it. They annoy him by crying out, Na‘lat
Šaitan, <i>i. e.</i>, Satan be cursed. Moreover, city people
keep aloof from the habitations of these despised
devil-worshippers. Accordingly the Yezidis have
little intercourse with their neighbors.</p>

of Al-ḳôš, and has sixteen villages. They are all
under the orders of Šeiḫ ‘Ali Beg Paša, the Amir, or
chief of the Yezidis. This tribe can furnish 1,600
guns for war. Said ‘Ali Paša has received from the
Turkish government the order of Amir ul-Umara
“the Amir of Amirs.” He has a brother who has
received the order of Miry Miran, “the Amirs of
Amirs.” He has a second brother who has received
the order of Romeli Beglar Begi, “the Beg of Begs.”
These three are all sons of the former Amir Husein
Beg.</p>

<p>2 The Denôdi tribe lives in Dakoke district. It
occupies fifteen villages, and can bring 800 guns to
war.</p>

<p>3 The Howari tribe lives in the region of Zaḫo.
This tribe is nomadic, lives in tents, and can furnish
200 guns for war. It has two chiefs, Bedri Sohr and
Dar Bazi Ḥusein. They are all shepherds.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Tribes of Midyat Region, Usually Called
Jabal Tor Al-‘Abedin (Mountain of the
Worshipers)</span></h4>

<p>This region lies one day’s journey east of Mardin.
There are three tribes here.</p>

<p>1 The tribe of Šemmike. This tribe inhabits six
villages and can produce, when needed, 500 guns.</p>

<p>2 The tribe called Soḥrani. There are fifteen
small villages to this tribe with 300 guns. These all
have houses built of stone, and till the ground.</p>

<p>3 The tribe called Mamila. This tribe has seven
villages:</p>

<p>Mazazah, Bajinne, Kochano, Keunos, Taka,
Harobia, and Namirdani.</p>

<p>Mr. Andrus writes me that he has learned of this
tribe from ḳas Samuel, a Jacobite Syrian priest of
Mazazeh near Midyat.</p>

<p>The tribe of Bešreyeh, northwest of Jabal Al-Tor.</p>

<p>There was only one tribe in this district; it was
called Ḫaltah. This tribe had five villages:</p>

<p>Reḍwan, Dooshah, Selaḫar, Bimbarik, and Ṣoolân.</p>

<p>On account of the oppression of the government on
the one hand, and of the Kurdish tribes around them
on the other, this tribe has moved to the Sinjar
Mountains.</p>

<p>The tribes around Weran Šahr or Goran Šahr, “the
destroyed or the sunken city,” because it was destroyed
by earthquake or in war. This district lies
southwest of Mardin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span></p>

<p>1 The Denodi tribe. This is probably an offshoot
of the Dahoke tribe of the same name. It occupies
three villages, and has Ḥasan ḳanjo for the chief.
He is now the right arm of Ibrahim Paša of the
Ḥamideyeh army. The three villages are Salmi,
Payamlo and Desi.</p>

<p>2 The tribe called Šerḳiân. This tribe has seven
subdivisions:</p>

<p>a. Turnah lives in one village called Laulanji.</p>

<p>b. ḳupan occupies four villages: (1) Aḫmazut.
(2) Nuḳti. (3) Al-Ašeḫan. (4) Ṣhda Auṣman.</p>

<p>c. Beleki has six villages: (1) Sahda Nasu. (2)
Mouzan Šeiḫ Bersef. (3) Mouzan Auṣo. (4) Menkšuri
Minet. (5) Al-ḳaureyee. (6) Menmenik.</p>

<p>d. Adi has three villages: (1) Tal Ṭarik.
(2) Karmi Apo ‘Alo Rešo. (3) Karmi Sim, u, Kor
Kahiah. Sim means hoof; u, and; kor, blind; kahiah,
head man.</p>

<p>e. Mardanah occupies two villages: (1) Hajj Zain.
(2) ḳara ḳuzeye.</p>

<p>f. Malla ḳachar has one village: Malla ḳachar
means the Malla flees.</p>

<p>g. Maskan occupies two villages: Birj Baluji.</p>

<p>h. Suḥan has one village, Kafar Bali.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />

<small><span class="smcap">Persecution</span></small></h3>


<p>The history of the Yezidis, like that of the Jews,
has been one of persecution. The causes of their
misfortune have been (1) the fact that they are not
regarded as the people of the Book; and with such
the Mohammedans have no treaty, no binding oath,
as they do with the other non-Mohammedan bodies.
For this reason they have to make choice between
conversion and the sword, and it is unlawful even to
take taxes from them. Consequently they must
accept the faith or be killed. (2) Their ceremonies
have given rise among their neighbors to fables confounding
their practices with those of the Nuṣairi of
Syria and ascribing to them certain midnight orgies,
which obtained for them the name of cheraḡ
sanderañ, i. e., the extinguishers of light. (3) Their
determined refusal to enter the military service. The
Yezidis with the Christians have been exempt from
the military service on the general law sanctioned by
the Koran; namely, that none but true believers can
serve in the armies of the state. But from time to
time the Turkish government has endeavored to raise
recruits for the regular troops among the Yezidis on
the ground that, being of no recognized infidel sect,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
they must be included like the Druses of Mount
Lebanon among Mohammedans. But they have resisted
the orders, alleging that their religious law
absolutely forbids them to take the oath to which the
Turkish soldiers are weekly subjected, to wear the
blue color and certain portions of the uniform, and to
eat several articles of food that are offered to the
troops. Hence they have suffered severely at the
hands of the local authorities.</p>

<p>One of the most cruel persecutions which the
Yezidis have suffered was that brought upon them in
the Šeiḫan district by the famous Beg Rawmanduz in
1832, who had united most of the Kurdish tribes of
the surrounding mountains under his command. His
cry was to crush the hateful sect of the devil-worshippers.
The forces of ‘Ali Beg, the then amir
of the Yezidis, were much inferior in number to those
of the Kurdish Beg. The latter (‘Ali Beg) was defeated,
therefore, and fell into the hands of his enemy,
who put him to death. The people of Šeiḫan fled to
Mosul. It was in the spring and the river had overflowed
and carried the bridge away. A few succeeded
in crossing, but the greater multitude of men, women
and children were left on the opposite side and
crowded on tal ‘Armus. The hostile Beg followed
and butchered them indiscriminately, showing no
mercy, while the people of Mosul were witnessing the
horrible massacre from the other side of the stream
and hearing the cry of the unfortunate for their help,
unwilling to render any assistance. For the Christians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
were helpless and Mohammedans rejoiced to see the
devil-worshippers exterminated. From this cruel
action of the Beg of Rawmanduz, the mounds of
Nineveh gained the name “Kuyunjik,” <i>i. e.</i>, “the
slaughter of the sheep.”</p>

<p>Soon after this Suleiman Paša of Bagdad sent a
large army to Sinjar under the command of Lutfee
Effendi, who set fire to the Jabal Sinjar and caused
all the inhabitants to flee. Then Ḥafiz Paša of
Diarbeker attempted the subjugation of the Yezidis
of Sinjar, on the ground that they were plunderers.
After meeting some resistance, he accomplished his
purpose in 1837, and appointed a Moslem to watch
over them. At another time Mohammed Rašid Pasha
of Mosul attacked Sinjar. On both occasions there
was a massacre. The Yezidis took refuge in caves,
where they were either suffocated by smoke or killed
by the discharge of cannon. And thus the population
was reduced by three-fourths. These and other
similar injustices at the hands of the Pašas of
Bagdad and Mosul and the Kurdish chiefs led the
Yezidis from time to time to send a deputation to lay
their grievances before the agents of the European
powers, and they have even sent commissioners to the
Sultan. They finally succeeded in enlisting the interest
of Lord Stratford in 1847 to obtain at Constantinople
a proper recognition of their religion and exemption
from military service.</p>

<p>But the severest of all persecutions, to which I was
an eye-witness, was perhaps the one which the Yezidis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
of both Šeiḫan and Sinjar suffered in 1892 at the
hands of Fariḳ ‘Omar Paša, Lieutenant-General of
the Turkish Army. This Fariḳ was sent in the
summer of 1892 as a special commissioner by the
Sultan to accomplish certain definite things in the
states of Mosul and Bagdad: to collect twenty years’
unpaid taxes; to induce the Bedouins to exchange
their nomadic life for village life; to convert the
Yezidis of Šeiḫan and Jabal Sinjar from their idolatry
to the true faith. He was a harsh man in his manners
and methods. He first invited some of their chiefs to
Mosul. They came and listened to what the new
Paša had to say. They met him when Mijlis al-Edarah,
council of the state, composed of ‘Olama and
a few Christians, was in session. In the presence of
these noblemen he began to tell them that if they would
give up their devil-worship, they would be rewarded
with high place and rank, and would please the great
Allah. But they answered not. When the Fariḳ saw
that his words failed to persuade them, he began to
apply the weapon of cruelty. He cast them into
prison; some died; others fled; and a few, through
the fear of torture and painful death, pronounced
al-šehâdah<a id="FNanchor_165_165" href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> with their lips but not from their hearts.
Then he sent an army to their villages, and commanded
them to choose between Islam and the sword.
‘Omar Beg, his son, who was commanding the soldiers,
directed them to slaughter the men, and take
captives the pretty women and girls and marry them.
He slew about five hundred men. Many became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
Moslems from fear, among these Merza Beg, their
civil chief.</p>

<p>Then he placed mullas among them to teach the
children the Muslim faith, and ordered the newly converted
Yezidis to pray five times every day and to
perform all the religious rites. To make them continue
to be Mohammedans, he tore down their shrines,
especially those at Baḥzanie and Baašiḳa. Such events
encouraged the Kurds to come down and add greater
cruelty to what was already done.</p>

<p>But amir ‘Ali Beg, their chief in civil and religious
affairs, after long imprisonment and torture, did not
change his religious belief. That he might not be an
example of firmness to the Yezidis, the Fariḳ banished
him with soldiers to Katamuni, a place near
Constantinople.</p>

<p>As a consequence of these persecutions, the number
of the Yezidis has been considerably decreased. In
the fifteenth century there were 250,000. At the beginning
of the nineteenth century there were 200,000.
They are still declining and remaining under the
clouds of misconception, and are consequently
objects of aversion and hatred. But they console
themselves with the idea that they suffer in the cause
of their religious convictions.</p>
